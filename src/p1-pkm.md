This short book was written and developed for a course on personal knowledge management taught at the
University of Kentucky's School of Information Science.

## How to Use this Book

### Text and Video

In the course I teach, most sections of this book will be accompanied by a video demonstrating the practices described in those sections.
Try to read through the text first, and then watch the video.
Revisit the text to help cement the ideas in place.

The video demonstrations are only available to students in my Personal Knowledge Management course.

### Markup

There are two markups that I want to bring to your attention:

Text that looks like **code blocks** indicate some kind of command that you should test for yourself.
For example, I demonstrate search queries in the sections that follow.
When I demonstrate a Google search, for example, the search query will appear in a standalone box
with a basic font and a different color background (depending on the theme you're using).

```

```

I occasionally insert some **asides** into the text.
These asides generally contain notes or extra comments about the main content.
Asides look like this:

> This is an aside.
> Asides will contain extra information, notes, or comments.

### Theme

At the top of the page is an icon of a paint brush.
The default theme is darker text on a light background, but you can change the theme per your preferences.

### Printing

I intend this book to be a live document, and therefore it'll be regularly updated.
But feel free to print it, if you want.
You can use the print function to save the entire book as a PDF file.
See the printer icon at the top right of the screen to get started.

## Introduction

Many people today use a variety of social media and text messaging platforms to communicate with each other, and
this is on top of, or in spite of, the existence and use of email,
which still reigns as the dominant mode of communication across a variety of industries.
We can refer to this experience of the abundance of communication platforms and the abundance of messaging on these platforms
as **communication overload**.
This concept basically means that there are too many messages coming at us from too many platforms.

Unfortunately, it's beyond the scope of this lecture to address strategies for managing communication from across multiple platforms,
but since email reigns supreme as a form of communication across manyindustries,
it's important to learn some strategies for managing our emails and avoiding inboxes with hundreds or thousands of unread email. 

## Strategies

The first set of readings listed above focus on overall strategies for managing our email inboxes.
The readings suggest a number of strategies, but the two main strategies focus on

1. **organizing our email** and
2. **searching for email**.

Some of the specific suggestions they make to implement those strategies will depend upon whether
we use email in the web browser, via a desktop application, or a phone app.
Thus it may take some exploration to figure out how to apply these lessons based on what you use.

### Organization

Each email service we use (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, etc.) offers similar but different ways to organize our email.
Here are some ways to organize your emails for two of the most common services, but 
keep in mind that the underlying principals apply elsewhere:

1. We can create folders (Outlook) or labels (Gmail), and then archive or group
   email into the respective folders or by the respective labels.
2. We can create **rules** to **filter** email to specific folders or by labels.
    
    For example, I have several folders in Outlook. I have a folder titled
    'university email' and a rule that sends all email from UK officials and UK
    mailings lists to that account. I have another folder titled 'Canvas
    email', where all email from my courses are routed to. And so on. Most of
    these emails are not time-sensitive (e.g., mailing list email) or it's
    simply helpful to group email by category (e.g., Canvas student email). 
    Using them helps keep email organized. As a student, you might
    want to create folders for specific courses, specific majors/minors,
    administrative functions (registration related emails, for example) and
    like.
    
    Gmail doesn't use the terms **rules** or **folders**, per say, but
    uses the concept of **filters** and **labels**. Gmail will automatically
    assign labels to your email, but you can apply more personalized labels,
    and then you can set up filters that automatically assigns labels that
    match the logic you set up with the filters.

### Searching

All email services provide some kind of search, even if implemented in different ways.
And like regular search engines, Outlook and Gmail both offer advanced searching abilities.

In Outlook, you can search:

- in specific folders
- by whom an email is **From** 
- by whom you sent an email **To**
- by a **CC** (carbon copy) address or person
- by **Subject** line
- by **Keywords** (that may appear in the email message),
- within specific dates,
- and you can limit results to specific dates

In Gmail, you can do most of same kinds of things, but you can also:

- search by email size
- and exclude emails that do not include certain terms

Searches are very similar to filters, and in fact, in both Outlook and Gmail,
you can save a search as a filter if you find that your search query can be re-used.

Searching not only helps you find specific emails on specific topics and within specific time frames,
it's also a good way to mass delete old and unnecessary email.

### Other Strategies

The *PC Mag* and [*The Washington Post*][washPost] (paywalled) articles suggest that **we turn off email notifications**.
The point is that if we receive a lot of emails, then email becomes too distracting.
Instead, *The Washington Post* suggests that we simply **check our email only a few times per day**
(but probably at most twice a day is sufficient).
The aim here is to be intentional about using email (and this applies to any other communication technology)
rather than being mindless and distracted by it.

*The Washington Post* article also suggests applying **the four Ds** to your emails:
"**do, delete, delegate or defer**.
It's up to you how to implement these ideas, but the main goal is to get rid of unnecessary email fast.
Don't let it accumulate.
The more emails that sit in our inbox, the more overwhelming it becomes afterward.
In fact, you can **unsubscribe** to everything that is not important. 

Another good idea is to keep personal and work email separate.
In fact, have more than one personal email account.
Use one personal as a throwaway account for signing up to random websites.
Use your main personal account for personal communication, banking, important social media accounts, and like.
Use your work account or your school account for work or school related tasks only.
Be mindful that your work or school account does not belong to you and
that you will lose that account when you leave a job or graduate from school.
In fact, the University of Kentucky has a [help page about your various UK accounts][ukgraduating] that you should read now.

As your lives become increasingly busy, if they're not already, using good Calendar and Task apps can help
keep our days organized and our to-do lists manageable.
Both Outlook and Gmail integrate **Tasks** and **Calendars**.
The readings above link to help pages on how to use these functions.
These are super time-saving functions for me. 

### Email Clients

Most of us probably use the web version of Gmail, Outlook, etc., but you can also use a email client, or app, for email.
The advantage with email apps is that they are oftentimes more powerful than the web app versions.
Example email clients include:

- [Apple Mail][apple_mail], available on Apple devices
- [Outlook for Windows][outlook_windows], available on Windows, Android, and iOS
- [Mozilla Thunderbird][mozilla_thunderbird], available on Windows and Android with iOS coming soon

Email apps (or clients) are not email providers even if they may be tied to some.
They are used for email, just as Google Docs and Microsoft Word are used for word documents.
You can use any of the above clients for any email service, including Outlook, Gmail, and more.

Email clients are designed to handle multiple email accounts and provide a unifying interface for all your email.
They can work offline, which can be helfpul when traveling or otherwise without a connection.
They are often better at search and some clients, like Thunderbird, can be ehanced with plugins or theming.
One of their main benefits is that they can download your email, which is useful if you lose or change email accounts.

## Conclusion

In addition to managing our personal knowledge, one of the main points of this work is
to become adept at using the various technologies that are available to us.
If we're only passive users of technology, then that technology can easily overwhelm us.
Active and intentional use of technology and of the specific functions that the technologies provide can actually
help improve our lives and our personal knowledge management workflows.

In this lesson, we learned how to think strategically about email services.
The two main strategies involve how to:

- organize our email, and how to
- search our email.

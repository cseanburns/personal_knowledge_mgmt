<p>This short book was written and developed for a course on personal knowledge management taught at the
University of Kentucky's School of Information Science.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-this-book">How to Use this Book</a></h2>
<h3 id="text-and-video"><a class="header" href="#text-and-video">Text and Video</a></h3>
<p>In the course I teach, most sections of this book will be accompanied by a video demonstrating the practices described in those sections.
Try to read through the text first, and then watch the video.
Revisit the text to help cement the ideas in place.</p>
<p>The video demonstrations are only available to students in my Personal Knowledge Management course.</p>
<h3 id="markup"><a class="header" href="#markup">Markup</a></h3>
<p>There are two markups that I want to bring to your attention:</p>
<p>Text that looks like <strong>code blocks</strong> indicate some kind of command that you should test for yourself.
For example, I demonstrate search queries in the sections that follow.
When I demonstrate a Google search, for example, the search query will appear in a standalone box
with a basic font and a different color background (depending on the theme you're using).</p>
<pre><code>basketball uky
</code></pre>
<p>I occasionally insert some <strong>asides</strong> into the text.
These asides generally contain notes or extra comments about the main content.
Asides look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an aside.
Asides will contain extra information, notes, or comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="theme"><a class="header" href="#theme">Theme</a></h3>
<p>At the top of the page is an icon of a paint brush.
The default theme is darker text on a light background, but you can change the theme per your preferences.</p>
<h3 id="printing"><a class="header" href="#printing">Printing</a></h3>
<p>I intend this book to be a live document, and therefore it'll be regularly updated.
But feel free to print it, if you want.
You can use the print function to save the entire book as a PDF file.

<h2 id="what-is-personal-knowledge-management-pkm"><a class="header" href="#what-is-personal-knowledge-management-pkm">What is personal knowledge management (PKM)?</a></h2>
<p>What is personal knowledge management (PKM)?
Well, I'd hazard a guess that most of us depend largely on two main sources to search for, locate, and retrieve information,
either on a daily basis or for more extensive work.
These two sources are <strong>the people we know</strong> and <strong>the search engines we use on a daily basis</strong>, like Google.
Relying on these two kinds of sources may get us by for many things.
However, there are times when we will require more rigorous sources because the task at hand
requires better information or the risks involved in making a decision are weighty enough to require more certainty.
Good, thorough information can reduce our uncertainty or enable us to measure levels of uncertainty, and
this is helpful when making decisions, writing papers, completing projects, and working at our first major job.
Therefore, in this book our first learning goal is focused on <strong>information sources</strong>, and specifically to:</p>
<ul>
<li>become aware of the variety of information sources that exist,</li>
<li>learn how to search those sources for relevant information, and</li>
<li>learn how to evaluate the relevant information that we find.</li>
</ul>
<p>This only covers part of what we mean by personal knowledge management.
In addition to being able to be aware of, to locate, and to evaluate information,
it is also important to manage that information and to develop good <strong>workflows</strong> that help with that.
What I mean is that, it may be great that we know that <a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/">UK Libraries</a> exists and that we can use it to locate good information,
but if we don't use the library or other great resources because we're not in the habit of doing so,
then what's the point of all this good information?
And what's the point in having access to all these information technologies that we have to become informed, to do good things, and
to make our lives better and easier?</p>
<p>Personally, I want to live in a <strong>good information age</strong> rather than merely an <strong>information age</strong>.
Therefore, our second learning goal is focused on the tools and technologies that will help us
build personalized information and knowledge workflows.
As stated above, often the point of acquiring good information is to perform some task or to make a decision.
A good workflow is good if it fits our style, or our way of getting things done, because that makes the workflow more likely to be followed.
A good workflow also maximizes our use of good sources of information as well as helps us to produce desired outcomes,
like a paper for a class, a project for a boss, or a decision that involves some uncertainty.</p>
<p>Our second learning goal is, therefore, focused on <strong>personal knowledge workflows</strong>, and specifically, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>become aware of the tools and technologies designed to manage personal knowledge workflows,</li>
<li>learn how to use these tools and technologies, and</li>
<li>incorporate these tools and technologies into our personal knowledge workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>Our final learning goal <strong>focuses on outcomes</strong> and builds off the first two goals.
Specifically, our final goal is to develop habits using the tools and technologies that incorporate a variety of good sources of information
in order to accomplish a task or make a decision.
That is, not only may we want to take advantage of the many kinds of information sources that exist, and
not only may we want to make it a habit of using those information sources in a habitual, personalized, effective way, but
we may also, as suggested earlier, want to accomplish some task.
It could be that we may simply want to satisfy our curiosity about a topic and learn more, which is great!
But there are times in our lives when we need to get things done (e.g., write a paper or create a software program) or
make a decision that involves some risk (e.g., buy a house or choose a healthcare procedure).
In those cases, having a personal knowledge workflow that incorporates high quality sources of information
facilitates accomplishing such tasks or making such decisions.</p>
<h3 id="topic-outline"><a class="header" href="#topic-outline">Topic Outline</a></h3>
<p>In order to accomplish the three goals above, this book covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>the differences between information sources and resources,</li>
<li>how to find new kinds of information sources and resources,</li>
<li>how to use reference management software,</li>
<li>how to search the web and databases, and</li>
<li>how to evaluate information sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book is also project based.
We will use the material and tools covered here to produce content for a Wikipedia article that you have selected.</p>
<h4 id="email-management"><a class="header" href="#email-management">Email Management</a></h4>
<p>I start this book by covering two basic topics in Chapter 2: email management and generative AI.
We begin with email management because email continues to be an important means of communication,
especially in professional contexts,
and because our inboxes can become easily overwhelming.
As a result, we may miss out on important information when our inboxes are overloaded.
Therefore, we will discuss ways to handle email effectively.</p>
<h4 id="generative-ai"><a class="header" href="#generative-ai">Generative AI</a></h4>
<p>I wrote the first version of this book during the summer of 2022,
just a few months before the public release of ChatGPT and later Google's Bard (now Gemini).
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a>, and other AI chatbots are designed to have human-like conversations with users.
They are super useful, interesting, and may even be fun.
They can produce papers, code, and much more for your classes as well help you (and me!) understand more about a variety of topics and issues.
To make my point, I asked ChatGPT and Gemini about what they do.
Here is what ChatGPT told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I am designed to
understand and generate human-like text based on the inputs I receive. I have
been trained on a wide variety of data sources, including books, articles,
websites, and other written content, allowing me to provide information and
engage in conversations on a wide range of topics. My purpose is to assist
users like you in finding answers, offering explanations, generating creative
content, and engaging in meaningful discussions. However, it's important to
note that while I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, I may
not always be perfect, and there are limitations to my knowledge and
understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is what Bard told me in 2022:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would describe myself as a large language model, also known as a
conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I
am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and
generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and
questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create
stories.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can answer your questions in a comprehensive and informative way, even if
they are open ended, challenging, or strange.</li>
<li>I can generate different creative text formats,  like poems, code, scripts,
musical pieces, email, letters, etc. I will try my best to fulfill all your
requirements.</li>
<li>I can translate languages.</li>
<li>I can write different kinds of creative content.</li>
<li>I can help you with your tasks, like setting reminders, making lists, and
playing music.</li>
<li>I can control your smart home devices.</li>
<li>I can help you stay organized and on track.</li>
<li>I can be your friend and companion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am still under development, but I am learning new things every day. I am
excited to see what the future holds for me, and I hope to be able to help
you in many ways.</p>

<p>In my experience, I have enjoyed using these services because they can make various tasks a bit easier.
But there are two things to note.
First, I've learned that there's a difference between <strong>using them</strong> and <strong>using them well</strong>,
just like there's a difference between entering basic search queries into Google search and using advanced search queries.</p>
<p>Second, there's a difference between using them for mindless work and using them as a substitute for our own thinking.
That is, personally, I like my brain and what it can do.
Activities like reading, writing, coding, and conversing are activities that help me learn and help me think, and that's good for my brain.
<em>I think, therefore, I am</em>, wrote the philosopher Descarte several centuries ago, and
we may want to be wary of how much we asking it to think for us in case we stop thinking for ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will spend a little time about on generative AI and learning how to use it well and ethically.
This means we will learn how to use it <strong>augment</strong> our thinking and manage what we're learning,
rather than to replace our thinking.</p>
<h4 id="remaining-lessons"><a class="header" href="#remaining-lessons">Remaining Lessons</a></h4>
<p>In Chapters 3 and 4, we focus more on the fundamentals of PKM.
In Chapter 3, we learn how to use the two major information resources: the library and the web.
We also learn about reference managers, which are a lot like advanced bookmarking applications.
These applications help us build our own collections of information sources and then use those sources as needed.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, we learn the basics of information search, or information retrieval, and
how it works on the web and in bibliographic databases, like we find using our library.
We also cover how to recognize relevant information and then evaluate it.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, we begin to focus on our final project, which is to edit a Wikipedia article.
We will cover additional resources, both from the library and the web, in order to find relevant information for our chosen Wikipedia page.
We will also use our reference manager to help with the project.
Chapter 5 is where we work to build out our personal knowledge workflow using the tools and techniques we covered in prior chapters.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>We live in a knowledge society.
Recognizing that, the goal of this course is to become effective at using the tools
to locate, evaluate, and use information in order to build personal knowledge workflows.
Let's get started.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="welcome-to-the-pkm-basics-section"><a class="header" href="#welcome-to-the-pkm-basics-section">Welcome to the PKM Basics Section!</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Chapter 2, the <em>PKM Basics</em> section of our Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) course.
In this section, we'll delve into two skills that are fundamental to managing our personal and professional knowledge effectively.</p>
<p>First we'll tackle <strong>Email Management</strong>.
We all know that our inboxes can feel like beasts that are impossible to tame.
We're going to explore strategies to organize, prioritize, and manage email more efficiently.
We'll learn how to reduce clutter, deal with important messages promptly, and
keep our sanity intact amidst the constant barrage of digital communication.</p>
<p>Second, we'll discuss the exciting (and worrisome???) world of <strong>Working with Generative AI</strong>.
Generative artificial intelligence is a powerful tool.
We'll look at how AI can help you to generate ideas and polish them.
But AI can also get you into trouble and can certainly help you <strong>cheat</strong> on your work.
Therefore, we'll discuss its ethical uses and learn how to use AI to augment our own thinking and intelligence rather than replace it.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is a bit of an island compared to the rest of the course.
While our focus in this chapter, like the remaining chapters,
is on building skills that will serve you well as students and knowledge workers,
the remaining lessons covered in this work focus on building skills and working towards a final project.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let's get started with email and AI.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Many people today use a variety of social media and text messaging platforms to communicate with each other, and
this is on top of, or in spite of, the existence and use of email,
which still reigns as the dominant mode of communication across a variety of industries.
We can refer to this experience of the abundance of communication platforms and the abundance of messaging on these platforms
as <strong>communication overload</strong>.
This concept basically means that there are too many messages coming at us from too many platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's beyond the scope of this lecture to address strategies for managing communication from across multiple platforms,
but since email reigns supreme as a form of communication across manyindustries,
it's important to learn some strategies for managing our emails and avoiding inboxes with hundreds or thousands of unread email.</p>
<h2 id="strategies"><a class="header" href="#strategies">Strategies</a></h2>
<p>The first set of readings listed above focus on overall strategies for managing our email inboxes.
The readings suggest a number of strategies, but the two main strategies focus on</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>organizing our email</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>searching for email</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the specific suggestions they make to implement those strategies will depend upon whether
we use email in the web browser, via a desktop application, or a phone app.
Thus it may take some exploration to figure out how to apply these lessons based on what you use.</p>
<h3 id="organization"><a class="header" href="#organization">Organization</a></h3>
<p>Each email service we use (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, etc.) offers similar but different ways to organize our email.
Here are some ways to organize your emails for two of the most common services, but
keep in mind that the underlying principals apply elsewhere:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can create folders (Outlook) or labels (Gmail), and then archive or group
email into the respective folders or by the respective labels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can create <strong>rules</strong> to <strong>filter</strong> email to specific folders or by labels.</p>
<p>For example, I have several folders in Outlook. I have a folder titled
'university email' and a rule that sends all email from UK officials and UK
mailings lists to that account. I have another folder titled 'Canvas
email', where all email from my courses are routed to. And so on. Most of
these emails are not time-sensitive (e.g., mailing list email) or it's
simply helpful to group email by category (e.g., Canvas student email).
Using them helps keep email organized. As a student, you might
want to create folders for specific courses, specific majors/minors,
administrative functions (registration related emails, for example) and
like.</p>
<p>Gmail doesn't use the terms <strong>rules</strong> or <strong>folders</strong>, per say, but
uses the concept of <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>labels</strong>. Gmail will automatically
assign labels to your email, but you can apply more personalized labels,
and then you can set up filters that automatically assigns labels that
match the logic you set up with the filters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="searching"><a class="header" href="#searching">Searching</a></h3>
<p>All email services provide some kind of search, even if implemented in different ways.
And like regular search engines, Outlook and Gmail both offer advanced searching abilities.</p>
<p>In Outlook, you can search:</p>
<ul>
<li>in specific folders</li>
<li>by whom an email is <strong>From</strong></li>
<li>by whom you sent an email <strong>To</strong></li>
<li>by a <strong>CC</strong> (carbon copy) address or person</li>
<li>by <strong>Subject</strong> line</li>
<li>by <strong>Keywords</strong> (that may appear in the email message),</li>
<li>within specific dates,</li>
<li>and you can limit results to specific dates</li>
</ul>
<p>In Gmail, you can do most of same kinds of things, but you can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>search by email size</li>
<li>and exclude emails that do not include certain terms</li>
</ul>
<p>Searches are very similar to filters, and in fact, in both Outlook and Gmail,
you can save a search as a filter if you find that your search query can be re-used.</p>
<p>Searching not only helps you find specific emails on specific topics and within specific time frames,
it's also a good way to mass delete old and unnecessary email.</p>
<h3 id="other-strategies"><a class="header" href="#other-strategies">Other Strategies</a></h3>
<p>The <em>PC Mag</em> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/email-management-tips-productivity/2021/08/27/36d80376-0692-11ec-8c3f-3526f81b233b_story.html"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> (paywalled) articles suggest that <strong>we turn off email notifications</strong>.
The point is that if we receive a lot of emails, then email becomes too distracting.
Instead, <em>The Washington Post</em> suggests that we simply <strong>check our email only a few times per day</strong>
(but probably at most twice a day is sufficient).
The aim here is to be intentional about using email (and this applies to any other communication technology)
rather than being mindless and distracted by it.</p>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em> article also suggests applying <strong>the four Ds</strong> to your emails:
"<strong>do, delete, delegate or defer</strong>.
It's up to you how to implement these ideas, but the main goal is to get rid of unnecessary email fast.
Don't let it accumulate.
The more emails that sit in our inbox, the more overwhelming it becomes afterward.
In fact, you can <strong>unsubscribe</strong> to everything that is not important.</p>
<p>Another good idea is to keep personal and work email separate.
In fact, have more than one personal email account.
Use one personal as a throwaway account for signing up to random websites.
Use your main personal account for personal communication, banking, important social media accounts, and like.
Use your work account or your school account for work or school related tasks only.
Be mindful that your work or school account does not belong to you and
that you will lose that account when you leave a job or graduate from school.
In fact, the University of Kentucky has a <a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/student-and-academic-life/graduating-what-do-your-uk-accounts-and-mail-you-go">help page about your various UK accounts</a> that you should read now.</p>
<p>As your lives become increasingly busy, if they're not already, using good Calendar and Task apps can help
keep our days organized and our to-do lists manageable.
Both Outlook and Gmail integrate <strong>Tasks</strong> and <strong>Calendars</strong>.
The readings above link to help pages on how to use these functions.
These are super time-saving functions for me.</p>
<h3 id="email-clients"><a class="header" href="#email-clients">Email Clients</a></h3>
<p>Most of us probably use the web version of Gmail, Outlook, etc., but you can also use a email client, or app, for email.
The advantage with email apps is that they are oftentimes more powerful than the web app versions.
Example email clients include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/mail">Apple Mail</a>, available on Apple devices</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/outlook-for-windows">Outlook for Windows</a>, available on Windows, Android, and iOS</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, available on Windows and Android with iOS coming soon</li>
</ul>
<p>Email apps (or clients) are not email providers even if they may be tied to some.
They are used for email, just as Google Docs and Microsoft Word are used for word documents.
You can use any of the above clients for any email service, including Outlook, Gmail, and more.</p>
<p>Email clients are designed to handle multiple email accounts and provide a unifying interface for all your email.
They can work offline, which can be helfpul when traveling or otherwise without a connection.
They are often better at search and some clients, like Thunderbird, can be ehanced with plugins or theming.
One of their main benefits is that they can download your email, which is useful if you lose or change email accounts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-1"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-1">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In addition to managing our personal knowledge, one of the main points of this work is
to become adept at using the various technologies that are available to us.
If we're only passive users of technology, then that technology can easily overwhelm us.
Active and intentional use of technology and of the specific functions that the technologies provide can actually
help improve our lives and our personal knowledge management workflows.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we learned how to think strategically about email services.
The two main strategies involve how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>organize our email, and how to</li>
<li>search our email.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="working-with-generative-ai"><a class="header" href="#working-with-generative-ai">Working with Generative AI</a></h1>
<p>Understanding and utilizing Generative AI
as a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tool
can be a useful way
to using applications
like
<a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>,
<a href="https://claude.ai">Claude</a>,
<a href="https://bard.google.com/chat">Bard</a>,
and others.
There are two fundamental keys
to success:</p>
<ul>
<li>asking good questions, and</li>
<li>engaging in lengthened exchanges with the AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>These interactions are not
only about getting answers;
they're about generating ideas,
creating content, and
making informed decisions,
which you'll further enrich
with credible information
from library and web sources
later in the semester.</p>
<p>In this section,
we'll delve into
the science of <strong>Prompt Engineering</strong>.
This is the act of crafting
your questions and commands
in a way that guides the AI
to understand and respond
with the most useful and
relevant information.
A well-constructed prompt
can be the difference between
getting a generic response and
unlocking valuable insights.</p>
<h2 id="reading"><a class="header" href="#reading">Reading</a></h2>
<p>Below I demonstrate a session
with Google Bard
where I construct a series
of prompts for Bard
to talk about prompt engineering.
The goal of the session
was to show how
using generative AI effectively
is iterative,
which means that
I apply answers from Bard
to generate new responses.</p>
<p>This session is based on
readings from several sources.
Before reading through the session,
please review the following
guides on prompt engineering
tactics and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering">OpenAI's Prompt Engineering Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The above link outlines the
importance of the following
in interacting with
generative AI:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write Clear Instructions</strong>: The clearer your request, the better the AI can meet your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Reference Text</strong>: Supplying context or examples can significantly steer the AI towards the kind of response you're looking for.</li>
<li><strong>Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks</strong>: Breaking down bigger challenges makes them more manageable for the AI.</li>
<li><strong>Give Generative AI Models Time to Think</strong>: Sometimes, complex queries require a moment for the AI to process and respond thoughtfully.</li>
<li><strong>Using External Tools</strong>: Learn how to integrate other tools and resources to augment the AI's capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Testing Changes Systematically</strong>: Experiment and evaluate how different approaches impact the AI's responses.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/examples">Prompt Engineering Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The above site provides important
information on prompting.
The <strong>Examples of Prompts</strong> page
covers the following topics
on ways to use generative AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>text summarization</li>
<li>information extraction</li>
<li>question answering</li>
<li>text classification</li>
<li>conversation</li>
<li>code generation</li>
<li>reasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong>Techniques</strong> section,
the Prompt Engineering Guide
describes multiple ways to engage
with generative AI.
The first few items listed
are good entry level approaches
to construct prompts.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>zero-shot prompting</li>
<li>few-shot prompting</li>
<li>chain-of-thought prompting</li>
</ul>
<p>And more.
Please read through these techniques.</p>
<h2 id="prompt-exchange-with-google-bard"><a class="header" href="#prompt-exchange-with-google-bard">Prompt Exchange with Google Bard</a></h2>
<p>The following is a link
to a session I conducted with Google Bard.
In this session,
I prompt Bard about prompt engineering,
and then work with Bard
to provide some examples
that demonstrate
<strong>few-shot prompting</strong> and
<strong>chain-of-thought</strong> prompting.
I then ask Bard to show
I could have improved my prompts,
and it offers some suggestions.
See the link below
to read through the session:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://g.co/bard/share/9259d0f7d154">Prompt Engineering: Crafting Instructions for AI (Example exchange)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="google-notebooklm"><a class="header" href="#google-notebooklm">Google NotebookLM</a></h2>
<p>One of the downsides
right now with generative AI clients
is that most applications
do not integrate a work flow
for using sessions with AI
into creating outputs,
like essays.
This is what something like
Google's new NotebookLM
seeks to solve.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">NotebookLM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For example,
in the prior session with Bard,
I asked Bard if it would
offer suggestions for improving
my prompts in a
use case involving using
generative AI to develop
a strategy for
writing an essay
on the ethics of generative AI.
Bard offered the following advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>add specificity within steps</li>
<li>provide examples and case studies</li>
<li>provide alternate perspectives</li>
<li>prompt for creative solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply these suggestions
using NotebookLM,
I can add my own documents and data.
NotebookLM lets users
create topical notebooks
and then add data from
their Google Drive accounts,
PDFs, and from copied text.
By doing this,
I would be able to address
Bard's suggestions to
provide examples and case studies
and to provide alternate perspectives
on a topic
as I collect information from
the library or the web.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-2"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-2">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Generative AI is a fairly new
technology that offers a lot of potential
for personal knowledge management.
In this lesson,
we learned how to use
generative AI effectively
by engaging in lengthy sessions
that involve creating well-constructed prompts.
To construct good prompts,
we employed tactics such as
<strong>few-shot prompting</strong> and
<strong>chain-of-thought</strong> prompting.</p>
<p>With new tools such as
Google's NotebookLM,
we learned how to
incorporate our own data
that we have collected to
continue to work on our prompts
and to generate new content,
ideas, and perhaps even, knowledge.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="welcome-to-using-information-resources-and-managing-information-sources"><a class="header" href="#welcome-to-using-information-resources-and-managing-information-sources">Welcome to Using Information Resources and Managing Information Sources</a></h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to this
part of our course
where we begin preparing
for the final project,
which is editing a
selected Wikipedia article.
To begin, we're going to focus
on two key components that are
vital for anyone delving
into the world of
personal knowledge management.</p>
<p>First, we'll explore how to
find, select, and utilize
various information resources.
You'll learn to navigate through
the information out there and
pinpoint what's relevant for your needs.
This will academic databases,
online journals, and
other digital libraries.
You will acquire the
skills to access and
make the most of these resources.</p>
<p>In the next section,
we'll dive into the
practical world of <strong>Reference Managers</strong>,
with a special focus on Zotero.
Reference managers are used to
support your research and information organization.
Specifically,
Zotero is a powerful application that helps
manage bibliographic data and related research materials.
We'll walk through its features,
from the basics of adding sources
to generating bibliographies.</p>
<p>This section lays the foundation
for the rest of the course.
The skills and concepts you acquire and learn here
will be integral to your success
in managing information effectively,
both in this course and
in your broader academic or professional endeavors.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="information-sources-and-resources"><a class="header" href="#information-sources-and-resources">Information Sources and Resources</a></h1>
<p><strong>Please visit the links as you read through this page.</strong></p>
<p>It's true that about anything
can be a source of information.
However, as we learn how
to search and use information,
it can be helpful if
we focus on sources and
their types.
Doing so allows us
to integrate different
source types of information
into our personal knowledge workflow.</p>
<h2 id="primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources"><a class="header" href="#primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources">Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources</a></h2>
<p>In general,
it's helpful to classify information sources
into three types:
primary, secondary, and tertiary.
Two of the main differences
between these three types of information
centers on the strength of evidence
they provide and on
their proximity to the topic they cover.
Primary sources generally provide
the strongest evidence on a topic and
are also closer to the topic
(i.e., more direct)
than secondary sources.</p>
<p>This is useful to know.
In fact, <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/sourcetypes/sourcetypeshome">UK Libraries</a>
provides use cases for these three
types and some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Primary sources provide direct or firsthand evidence about a topic. The creator of primary sources is often intimately connected with the topic or event. Most often, creators of primary sources are participants in the events they describe, either directly or by virtue of living during the time period in question. Given this broad definition, primary sources comprise a wide range of resource types across the various disciplines" (<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/sourcetypes/primary">Primary Sources</a>).</li>
<li>"Secondary sources depend upon primary sources. Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources. The important thing to keep in mind when trying to decide if a source is primary or secondary is whether or not the author did the thing they are reporting on. If they did, it is a primary source; if they did not, it is a secondary source" (<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/sourcetypes/secondary">Secondary Sources</a>).</li>
<li>"Tertiary sources contain information that has been compiled from primary and secondary sources. They organize information in an easily accessible way and often point the researcher to the primary and secondary literature on a given topic" (<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/sourcetypes/tertiary">Tertiary Sources</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's expand on that a bit more:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Primary Sources</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Research Papers and Studies</strong>: These are original research documents written by researchers or scholars. They include firsthand data, experiments, observations, and findings. For example, a scientific paper reporting the results of an experiment on the effects of cold water immersion on the human body would be a primary source.</li>
<li><strong>Diaries and Personal Journals</strong>: Personal writings of individuals that offer insights into their thoughts, experiences, and daily life. For instance, a diary kept by a historical figure discussing their experiences during a particular period.</li>
<li><strong>Interviews and Oral Histories</strong>: Recorded conversations with individuals who have firsthand knowledge of specific events or topics. This can include oral history interviews with people who experienced significant historical events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Sources</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Books</strong>: Books written by experts or scholars that analyze and interpret primary sources or provide an overview of a particular subject. For example, a book discussing the history of computing and the evolution of the command line since the 1970s.</li>
<li><strong>Review Articles</strong>: Scholarly articles that summarize and analyze existing research in a particular field. They provide a synthesis of primary research findings.</li>
<li><strong>Documentaries</strong>: Video or film productions that present information, often through interviews and visuals, to explain and explore a topic. Documentaries can be considered secondary sources when they provide analysis and context.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tertiary Sources</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Encyclopedias</strong>: General reference works that provide concise summaries and explanations of topics. They often compile information from various secondary sources. Examples include online encyclopedias or reference books.</li>
<li><strong>Textbooks</strong>: Educational books designed for teaching a subject. They distill information from primary and secondary sources to provide structured knowledge on a topic.</li>
<li><strong>Databases and Indexes</strong>: Online databases that organize and index primary and secondary sources, making it easier to search for relevant information. Examples include academic databases like PubMed, Academic Search Premier, or library catalogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can summarize the above list and definitions
into the following table:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Type of Source</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th><th><strong>Examples</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Primary Sources</strong></td><td>Original firsthand accounts or data.</td><td>- Research Papers and Studies<br>- Diaries and Personal Journals<br>- Interviews and Oral Histories</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Secondary Sources</strong></td><td>Analysis and interpretation of primary sources.</td><td>- Books<br>- Review Articles<br>- Documentaries (when providing analysis)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tertiary Sources</strong></td><td>Summaries and reference sources.</td><td>- Encyclopedias<br>- Textbooks<br>- Databases and Indexes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Although the difference
between these types
is related to the
strength of their evidence
and their proximity to their topic,
it's not helpful to think of
this ordering as the way
to search for information.
As you learn how to locate
information and
conduct research,
you will largely depend
mostly on tertiary and
secondary sources of information.
For example,
a reference work,
like a dictionary, encyclopedia, a bibliographic database, or even a search engine,
is considered a tertiary source
but can be an ideal place
to learn about a topic and
to learn how to get primary or secondary
information about that topic.
We do not generally cite tertiary sources,
like Wikipedia or Google,
of information in our papers or other works,
unless it seems important to do so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note however they we also do not plagiarize from these sources. If you do
decide to use them as direct sources, then you need to cite them and quote
them if you decide to use the text, etc that they provide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, a book or a review article,
as examples of secondary sources,
can serve as a great summary, discussion,
distillation, or commentary on a topic,
and can also,
in its discussion of a topic,
provide references to more
sources of information,
which may be other secondary sources
or even primary sources.
For example,
a scholarly book on
censorship in public libraries
should include references
to research papers on that topic.</p>
<p>Finally, primary sources are sources
that lie closest to the topic.
As the table and list above indicate,
they may include academic research,
diaries, interviews, and more,
much of which is based on or is
the source of direct analysis.
This type of information can
often be the most difficult to read
and interpret,
because it may require extensive
domain knowledge of the topic.</p>
<p>Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources
say something about the kind of evidence
in those respective sources.
They are,
in a sense,
a ranking of the strength of their evidence
about a topic.
Primary sources provide the strongest evidence.
However, when searching for information,
it is often better to begin
with tertiary sources.</p>
<h2 id="information-resources-of-information-sources"><a class="header" href="#information-resources-of-information-sources">Information Resources of Information Sources</a></h2>
<p>In practice, these distinctions are important.
If I do a <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY">library search</a>,
I have the option to narrow my search by <strong>Resource Type</strong>.
These resource types,
in conjunction with types of information sources,
help us locate the information we need
and identify the strength of that information.
Example resource types in UK's catalog include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Newspaper articles</li>
<li>Dissertations</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Book chapters</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Reports</li>
<li>Reference entries</li>
<li>Conference proceedings</li>
<li>Datasets</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Government documents</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>A resource is really a thing that supplies a thing,
whatever that thing is.
For our purposes,
we can think of information resources
as providers of information sources,
like those listed above.
One of the more important resources
we can use are databases.
Databases are great <strong>resources</strong>
for locating <strong>sources of information</strong>.
The term <strong>database</strong> itself is a bit problematic
because it has multiple meanings, and
I think it will help if we start this section by clarifying what
we mean in this course by the term <em>database</em>.</p>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01SAA_UKY/ija67f/cdi_proquest_ebookcentral_EBC3312345"><em>Dictionary of Information Science and Technology</em></a>,
the term <strong>database</strong> can be defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a collection of files containing related information. Database consists of
files and each file consists of records. Furthermore, each record consists of
fields, which can be used to store the raw facts or data (p. 246).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition is not wrong, per se, but
it is rather broad and therefore not entirely useful.
For example,
the definition entails that if I have a folder on my desktop, and
if that folder contains only Excel spreadsheets on related content, and
since those spreadsheets contain only records
(i.e., rows) and fields (i.e., cells), then
that folder on my desktop is a database.
Although I suppose that's kind of true,
I don't think that's really what the dictionary authors have in mind, and
thus it's not an accurate enough nor a very useful definition.</p>
<p>A more specific and applicable definition is provided by the
<a href="http://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d#database"><em>Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science</em></a>,
which defines a <strong>database</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large, regularly updated file of digitized information (bibliographic
records, abstracts, full-text documents, directory entries, images,
statistics, etc.) related to a specific subject or field, consisting of
records of uniform format organized for ease and speed of search and
retrieval and managed with the aid of database management system (DBMS)
software. Content is created by the database producer (for example, the
American Psychological Association), which usually publishes a print version
(Psychological Abstracts) and leases the content to one or more database
vendors (EBSCO, OCLC, etc.) that provide electronic access to the data after
it has been converted to machine-readable form (PsycINFO), usually on CD-ROM
or online via the Internet, using proprietary search software.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most databases used in libraries are catalogs, periodical indexes,
abstracting services, and full-text reference resources leased annually under
licensing agreements that limit access to registered borrowers and library
staff. Abbreviated db. Compare with data bank. See also: archival database,
bibliographic database, embedded database, metadatabase, and niche database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above definition is more helpful because
it provides examples of content type
(e.g., bibliographic records, abstracts, full-text documents, etc) and
how to access that content
(e.g., library catalogs, periodical indexes),
because it partitions out the components of a database
(records, search, retrieval), and
because it distinguishes a <em>database</em> proper from
a <em>database management system (DBMS)</em>,
which is what the prior definition was attempting to define.
The <em>ODLIS</em> definition also highlights the role of database producers
in producing databases (e.g., the American Psychological Association),
which tells us something about the subject matter of a database
(e.g., psychology).</p>
<h2 id="what-are-example-databases"><a class="header" href="#what-are-example-databases">What are example databases?</a></h2>
<p>The <em>ODLIS</em> definition provides some leads to this question.
The definition tells us that example databases include
"digitized information containing bibliographic records,
abstracts, full-text documents, directory entries,
images, and statistics"
that are "related to a specific field or subject," and
that these can be accessed through library "catalogs,
periodical indexes, abstracting services, and
full-text reference resources."
Given that, let's look at some examples.</p>
<h3 id="library-catalogs-and-discovery-services"><a class="header" href="#library-catalogs-and-discovery-services">Library Catalogs and Discovery Services</a></h3>
<p>We'll start with the most general example, and
that's the <strong>library catalog</strong>.
Traditionally, library catalogs are databases
that primarily provided information about where we could
find content on a library's shelves
(i.e., print content).
However, given that more content is available online,
nowadays these catalogs are more often referred to as discovery services.
In this expanded role,
not only can they tell us where to find a book on a shelf,
but they can also provide full text access to online content in other databases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can access the University of Kentucky's library catalog/discovery service
at their main website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/"><strong>https://libraries.uky.edu</strong></a></p>
<p>Please visit the link and test your own searches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the center of UK Libraries' homepage,
we find several links of interest:
the <strong>InfoKat (Books and More)</strong> link,
the <strong>Database</strong> link, and
the <strong>Journals</strong> link.</p>
<p>InfoKat searches  <strong>bibliographic records</strong>.
It does not provide full text access.
Instead, they provide access
by linking to content or
by providing physical directions to that content.
For example, if that content is a print item
someplace on the library's shelves,
InfoKat might tell us it's located on the
5th floor of WT Young and has the call number <strong>Z674.82.159 S42 1996</strong>,
or something like that.
However, if that content is online,
then InfoKat should give us a direct link to it.
It could also be that the InfoKat
has records for information sources but
not the actual sources themselves.
In those cases, the bibliographic records should provide
a link to request the item through interlibrary loan (ILL).</p>
<p>Google and other search engines function in much the same way.
If I do a search for the term <strong>databases</strong> in Google,
the search engine will return results to sites
that are relevant to that term,
like a Wikipedia article on databases.
Google itself does not store the full text content and
only provides access (i.e., links) to content
based on its own indexing of where things are on the web.
Unlike the library's catalog,
if Google returns results for pages it
cannot access or that don't exist anymore,
there is no ILL service offered, and
we're left to our own devices to find access to that information.</p>
<h3 id="periodical-indexes-and-abstracting-services"><a class="header" href="#periodical-indexes-and-abstracting-services">Periodical Indexes and Abstracting Services</a></h3>
<p>InfoKat returns a wide variety of bibliographic records
that describe and provide access to
books, ebooks, book chapters, maps,
scholarly articles, news articles, images, and more.
InfoKat is therefore great as a discovery service
because it functions as a kind of catchall
for all the types of works that a library can provide access to,
as just listed.
However, there will be times when we will want to focus our search
to a more limited subset of records,
such as those that produced by periodicals.</p>
<p>Periodicals are nothing more than magazines and journals.
This kind of genre produces issues at regular
(or even at irregular) intervals,
such as weekly, bimonthly, monthly, or quarterly issues,
with no pre-determined end.
Periodicals focus on different audiences,
such as the general public (e.g., Time magazine),
parts of the general public
(e.g., <em>WIRED</em>, <em>Elle</em>, <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>),
the general scholarly community (e.g., <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em>),
or to specific scholarly communities
(e.g, <em>Journal of Information Technology</em>,
<em>Journal of Synchrotron Radiation</em>, <em>Journal of Sociology</em>).
Scholarly journals are generally (but not always) peer-reviewed journals,
which means that when authors submit their manuscripts
to these journals,
the manuscripts are sent out to two to three peers
in the scholarly community who read the manuscripts and
write recommendations to the editors for improving the manuscript,
or who recommend that the journal editor reject the manuscript.
Different journals and different scholarly disciplines
have different criteria for making judgments on quality.</p>
<p>There are two broad ways to locate sources in periodicals.
At the UK Libraries <a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/">homepage</a>,
we can select the <strong>Journals</strong> link or the <strong>Databases</strong> link.
The <strong>Journals</strong> link lets us search for specific journal titles and,
if desired, within disciplinary/subject categories
(e.g., Health &amp; Biological Sciences, Law,
Politics &amp; Government, Language &amp; Literature, or Social Sciences,
Journalism &amp; Communications, and more).
Once we locate a journal of interest,
we can visit the link and then search within that journal or
peruse the table of contents for specific issues.</p>
<p>The <strong>Databases</strong> link lets us expand our search of records to broader
categories or subject areas of periodicals.
Here we find databases like
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/4"><em>Academic Search Complete</em></a>,
which will let us search thousands of periodicals,
including magazines and scholarly journals,
across a range of subject categories.
<em>JSTOR</em> is another database that indexes a broad subject
range of periodicals but with greater emphasis on peer-reviewed material.
Databases may also have a specific focus.
For example, the <a href="http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://www.aac.amdigital.co.uk/"><em>African American Communities</em></a>
database provides access to archival and historical papers,
oral histories, essays, letters, pamphlets, and
newspapers on African American communities and
is geographically focused on
Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and parts of North Carolina.
Then we also have access to databases like the <em>Kentucky Building Code</em>,
which is a database that links to
residential and commercial regulatory information on building,
plumbing, design in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Many of the resources listed above,
as well as the hundreds that UK Libraries offers and
that I have not described,
provide access to full-text content.
But this isn't necessarily so.
All that a periodical index must offer to be
classified as such are records that contain basic information,
such as article titles, author names, publication names,
publication date information, and often subject terms.
Abstracting services provide the same information but also
provide abstracts of journal articles,
which are searchable.
Since abstracts provide summary information of the main articles,
this is helpful in locating information sources.</p>
<h3 id="full-text-resources"><a class="header" href="#full-text-resources">Full-text Resources</a></h3>
<p>Since periodical indexes and abstracting services
do not necessarily provide direct full text access,
you might wonder what the point is if
you can't get the full text of some source
that the library tells you exists.
The point is that even if the library doesn't
have immediate access to a source,
if it can tell you that it exists,
then a librarian can likely get the
source through interlibrary loan (which is fast!) or some other means.
So if the stakes are high
(e.g., you are a cancer researcher) and
you really need or just want information
(e.g., about a cancer therapy),
then periodical indexes and abstracting services are
great resources even if they do not provide immediate full text access.</p>
<p>That said, in addition to a
variety of periodical indexes and abstracting services,
UK Libraries provides quite a few full text databases.
Visit the <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/az.php">A-Z Databases page</a> to see all of your choices.
A full-text database may also be an abstracting service,
if it provides the basic information listed above
(title, author name, etc) about periodical content.
It becomes a full-text abstracting database
if it also provides access to the full-text source.
Other non-periodical database,
like the <em>African American Communities</em> database,
also provides full text access to its sources,
and may even be thought of as a <strong>digital library</strong>
and not just a database.</p>
<p>In the next few paragraphs below,
I will focus on a few general purpose full-text databases
that you may find helpful as you work towards your degree.
Although these databases provide full-text sources,
they may not provide full-text to everything they have records for, though.</p>
<h4 id="academic-search-complete"><a class="header" href="#academic-search-complete">Academic Search Complete</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/4"><em>Academic Search Complete (ASC)</em></a> is a database of databases.
It can search over 60 different databases and indexes,
each including hundreds of journal titles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Communication and Mass Media Complete</em></li>
<li><em>Sociological Collection</em></li>
<li><em>Music Index</em></li>
<li><em>SPORTDiscus</em></li>
<li><em>MEDLINE</em></li>
<li><em>eBook K-8 Collection</em>,</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <em>ASC</em>, we can search all 60 plus databases at one time,
or we can select one or more of them,
which might make better sense.
For example, if we were interested health related information,
we might want to search the following <em>ASC</em> databases at once:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Consumer Health Reference eBook Collection</em></li>
<li><em>Health and Psychosocial Instruments</em></li>
<li><em>MEDLINE</em></li>
<li><em>APA PsycInfo</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="proquest"><a class="header" href="#proquest">ProQuest</a></h4>
<p>Like <em>ASC</em>, <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/90"><em>ProQuest</em></a> provides access
to many subject based databases, and also,
many of the database topics overlap.
ProQuest uses this to highlight database collections.
For example, the <em>SciTech Premium Collection</em> includes
three databases that can be searched at once.
These include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Natural Science Collection</em></li>
<li><em>Science Database</em></li>
<li><em>Technology Collection</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ProQuest's <em>Social Science Premium Collection</em> includes databases on
criminology, education, library and information science, politics, sociology,
and more.</p>
<p>ProQuest also provides database access to magazines and news content,
including <em>The Vogue Archive</em> and various current and historical newspapers,
such as an archive of <em>The New York Times</em> or
current issues of <em>The Courier-Journal</em> (Louisville, KY).</p>
<h4 id="jstor"><a class="header" href="#jstor">JSTOR</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/266"><em>JSTOR</em></a> is another multi-disciplinary database. JSTOR covers subjects
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts</li>
<li>Business &amp; Economics</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Medicine &amp; Allied Health</li>
<li>Science &amp; Mathematics</li>
<li>Security studies</li>
<li>Social Sciences, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these subject areas includes access to many journal titles,
and therefore, many journal articles.
<em>JSTOR</em> has long focused on back issues of journals,
but in recent years has made moves to include current literature and
open access content
(this content that is freely available).
<em>JSTOR</em> also includes <a href="https://www.artstor.org/public-collections/"><em>ARTSTOR</em></a>,
a database of images, video, and other multimedia content,
much of which is also available as open access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Open access (OA) content is content that
is freely available to access.
That does not, however, mean that the content is
free of copyright protections.
There are different types of OA copyright licenses
and each will stipulate how we can use that content.
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/">CreativeCommons.org</a> provides a list of some
of the more popular licenses and what the mean for us.
In all cases, though, if you use OA content,
be sure to attribute it with source information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion-3"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-3">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Remember, one of the main ideas of this course is
that there are many sources of information that are not
easily available via Google or some other search engine.
Even when we do use Google or Bing or Yahoo or something else,
there are certain advanced tricks we can use to
leverage them to find better information.
We'll cover those soon.
Regardless, if we apply what we'll learn in this class,
we'll become that much more accomplished.</p>
<p>In short, we are going to learn a bit
more about what's hidden from most users and from the common view.
To do that,
we needed to understand the difference between <strong>information sources</strong>
and <strong>information resources</strong>.
Information sources can be divided into three types:
primary, secondary, and tertiary.
The differences among them
center around the strength
of the evidence they provide
and their proximity to their topic.
However, when searching for information,
it is often better to begin with
tertiary and secondary sources.
In the end, in <strong>information source</strong> is the main item
we often aim to acquire.</p>
<p>An <strong>information resource</strong> is a tool
that provides or supplies access to information sources.
In this section, some examples of information resources
are the library discovery service, a search engine,
and a database like <em>JSTOR</em>, <em>ASC</em>, or <em>ProQuest</em>.
These are all tertiary sources that can lead
us to more substantial sources of
primary and secondary information.</p>

<h2 id="readings-1"><a class="header" href="#readings-1">Readings</a></h2>
<p>Please visit the links in this section as you read through it, and
read through the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/">Zotero Documentation</a>,
especially after watching the accompanying software demonstration.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Now that I have introduced you to
some of the different resources for information sources
that exist (and we will learn about more),
our next personal knowledge management challenge
involves managing the information
sources that we locate and want to use.</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that we need to locate and
use three academic sources for a class paper assignment.
We could, like probably many do,
search for information on the fly,
locate some journal articles,
figure out how to cite the articles, and
manually add the citations to our Word documents.
Perhaps if we're a little more advanced,
we could download the papers to a folder on our computer
for later reference
(perhaps we have a folder dedicated to the class paper and
even a subfolder dedicated to any readings that we download).
Although that might be a bit more organized,
it is the 21st century, and
we have these computers that can do so much more
for us than act as simple file cabinets.
Basically, if we want to be more efficient,
to save time, and to do a good job,
then this is not the way.</p>
<p>Instead, we can use a <strong>reference manager (RM)</strong>
(also called a <em>citation manager</em>).
A RM is a piece of software that can help us manage
this process of saving, collecting, and using information sources.
Although generally aimed at academic users,
RMs can also be used to bookmark, save, and
collect all sorts of web and print information sources and
for all sorts of outcomes,
whether those outcomes are class papers,
engineering projects, musical composition projects,
biology experiments, and so on.
Basically, if we use the web to collect and
then use information, then <em>this is the way</em>.</p>
<h2 id="reference-manager-software"><a class="header" href="#reference-manager-software">Reference Manager Software</a></h2>
<p>You are required to use a RM in this course, and
I will focus on the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> RM.
However, you are free to choose other options,
even if I don't cover them, and
there are many.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software">Wikipedia</a> has a page that lists around 20 RM options.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons I will focus on Zotero, though.
First, I use it, and I know it fairly well,
although I'm always learning new things about it.
But most importantly, it's free (and open source software),
it's consistently maintained and updated,
it provides all the major functions that a RM should provide and more, and
it's available on Windows and macOS
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">desktop and laptop computers</a>.
For iOS (i.e., mobile) users,
there is an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zotero/id1513554812">app for the iPhone and iPad</a>, but
Android users can access their Zotero library
using their phone's web browsers,
which is just as good as the dedicated app.</p>
<p>If you elect to use an alternate RM,
be aware that they are not all created equal.
The two most popular, functional, and well-supported alternatives are
<a href="https://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> and <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/endnote">EndNote</a>.
Both of these are are more academic-centric,
while Zotero is more agnostic about source information and usage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mendeley and EndNote are more academically oriented
because they are owned by companies involved with
academic publishing and academic databases.
Mendeley is owned by the company Elsevier,
which provides the <a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/lnkr.php?lir_id=3347"><em>Scopus</em></a> database,
a bibliographic, abstract, and citation database, and
publishes multiple journal titles.
EndNote is owned by Clarivate, a research analytics company,
which provides the <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/467"><em>Web of Science</em></a> and <em>ProQuest</em> databases.
<em>Web of Science</em> is a citation database like <em>Scopus</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="zotero"><a class="header" href="#zotero">Zotero</a></h2>
<p>Gilmour &amp; Cobus-Kuo (2011) identify eight functions
that a RM should provide, and
Zotero performs all of these functions.
These functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import citations from bibliographic databases and websites</li>
<li>Gather metadata from PDF files</li>
<li>Allow organization of citations w/in the reference manager database</li>
<li>Allow annotations of citations</li>
<li>Allow sharing of the reference management database</li>
<li>Allow data interchange with other reference manager products through
standard metadata formats</li>
<li>Produce formatted citations in a variety of styles</li>
<li>Work with word processing software to facilitate in-text citation (Gilmour &amp;
Cobus-Kuo, 2011, Introduction section).</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of which RM we use,
we want to pick one that performs most
if not all of the above functions because these
functions help us identify a useful app.
Fortunately, the
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide">Zotero Quick Start Guide</a>
provides a nice overview of the basic functions and
how to use those functions, and
the additional documentation describes how to do more.
Fortunately, Zotero satisfies the requirements listed above.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Zotero Quick Start Guide shows us how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install and open the Zotero desktop/laptop application</li>
<li>Install and use the Zotero browser plugin
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/">download page</a> provides links for using Zotero with:

<p>Welcome to the segment
on retriving and evaluation information.
We're going to hone our skills
in digging up and assessing
the vast information
that's available to us.</p>
<p>First, we'll dive into <strong>Web Information Retrieval</strong>.
Ever wonder how the internet is organized and
how you can use this organization to your advantage?
We'll explore just that,
enhancing your ability
to conduct effective searches
on the web.
This is about finding
the right information quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Next, we'll shift gears to
<strong>Bibliographic Database Information Retrieval</strong>.
Here, you'll learn
the ins and outs of
bibliographic records and
the art of using Boolean operators.
These tools are key
to navigating bibliographic databases and
uncovering the specific information
you need for your research or projects.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll focus on <strong>Evaluating Information Sources</strong>.
In an age where information is abundant,
the ability to critically assess
the reliability and quality of information is crucial.
We'll discuss techniques
like narrative probability and lateral reading,
helping you to develop a keen eye for credible sources.</p>
<p>This section is about equipping you
with the tools and know-how
to efficiently retrieve and
critically evaluate information:
skills that are indispensable
in our information-rich world.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Whether we want to search the web,
a bibliographic database,
or our Zotero library,
it's helpful to know about
information retrieval in
order to become good at search.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we'll cover specific search techniques
that you can use to get better
using search engines like
Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.
Specifically, there are three principles
that we need to consider
when advancing our search skills.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 1:</strong> We should understand that the
basic information retrieval model centers on <strong>documents</strong>.
Anything indexed in a database or on the web is treated as a document.
Documents include text, sound, images, video, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2:</strong> We should understand that documents
do not exist independently of other documents.
This is called the <strong>corpus</strong>.
For the web, the <strong>corpus</strong> is organized
like a <strong>file system</strong>,
much like the file system on your personal computers.
In a bibliographic database,
the <strong>corpus</strong> is organized by predefined fields
such as author names, title names, subject terms, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3:</strong> Our queries are not divorced from the <strong>documents</strong>
nor the <strong>corpus</strong> nor the <strong>organization of the corpus</strong>.
These things are all intertwined.
Each time we search,
search engines and databases compare
<strong>documents</strong> in the <strong>corpus</strong>
to each other and to how they are organized
based on our <strong>queries</strong>,
and then rank order (in some way) those documents
by way of that comparison.
Hence, when we <strong>construct queries</strong>,
it's useful to think about the content (corpus)
that we are searching.</p>
<p>To rehash, a search engine or database uses our queries,
matches them against how they index the corpus (i.e., the web),
and then rank orders the search results based
on the query and the corpus.</p>
<p>To illustrate the above concepts,
I'll primarily focus on searching the web in this section, but
these techniques work across the databases
that we use in a library.
We'll cover that
in the following section.</p>
<h2 id="the-web-is-for-storing-and-retrieving-documents"><a class="header" href="#the-web-is-for-storing-and-retrieving-documents">The web is for storing and retrieving documents</a></h2>
<p>When we use Google or another search engine to search,
we often look for documents (web pages, websites, etc.)
in a corpus
that contain specific text
that match our query.
This has some implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Text</em> has primacy, even for multimedia, which is often described using text.</li>
<li>Our queries are matched against the text that appears in documents on the web
or that describes documents on the web.</li>
<li>The better our queries match the documents, the more precise our search
results will be. This assumes we can construct good queries.</li>
<li>The more ambiguous our queries are, the more work the search engine has to do
to find relevant results.</li>
<li>The challenge with search is that we do not always know what text a document
contains even if that document covers the topic or concept that we think is
relevant.
<ul>
<li>For example, consider <em>synonyms</em>. We might want to find web pages that
contain terms that are synonymous with our query term but do not actually
contain our query term. But this can get complicated. If I search for
<strong>star</strong>, could I also mean <strong>principal, lead, hero, celebrity,
stellar</strong>, or <strong>sun</strong>?</li>
<li>What if a document only uses terms like <strong>principal, lead, hero,
celebrity, stellar</strong>, or <strong>sun</strong>? Might it still be useful if I was
interested in documents (i.e., web pages) about <strong>star</strong>? Probably not
since some of those words, although synonymous with <strong>star</strong>, are not
synonymous with each other. Compare the terms <strong>principal</strong> and
<strong>celebrity</strong>. Both of these terms are synonymous with the term <strong>star</strong>
but they are not synonymous with each other. Therefore, the synonyms of a
term may not be synonymous with each other.</li>
<li>Other <em>wordy</em> issues include things like <em>homonyms</em>, which are words that
are pronounced or spelled the same but mean different things. Thus, by
<strong>bark</strong> do I mean the bark on a tree or the word we use to signal the
sound a dog makes?</li>
<li>Phrases are also important, with respect to <strong>term order</strong>. If I search
using a phrase where the term <strong>forest</strong> precedes the term <strong>fire</strong>,
search engines are more likely to return results where those two terms
appear in that order. This will mean that documents that contain text
about someone having a <strong>camp fire in a forest</strong> will be less likely to
appear at the top of my results than a document that contains the phrase
<strong>the forest is on fire</strong>.</li>
<li>Or consider <strong>term adjacency</strong>. Documents where the terms are in order
but spaced far apart will also rank lower. E.g., if the term <strong>forest</strong>
appears in the first paragraph on a web page and the term <strong>fire</strong>
appears on the last paragraph of a web page, this web page will rank
lower than a page that contains the terms near or adjacent to each other
when searching using a query like <strong>forest fire</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-web-is-organized"><a class="header" href="#the-web-is-organized">The web is organized</a></h2>
<p>I mentioned above that the web
is a file system,
the kind that you'd find on your own computer
with its folders and files.
By this I mean that <strong>the web is organized</strong>.
If we know a bit about its organization,
we can take good advantage of that when we search.
For instance, we can narrow our searches to parts of the web.
So the questions are: how is it organized?
And how can we use that organization in search?</p>
<ul>
<li>The web is organized like a tree. This tree like structure originally
contained a few main branches, called <strong>top level domains (TLDs)</strong>. Example
TLDs are .com, .edu, .org, .gov, .mil, and .net. All domains then branched
off of those main branches.</li>
<li>The tree has grown over the years and now contains nearly 1451 (as of
February 2024) of these main branches (TLDs). Newer TLDs include .apple,
.attorney, .camera, .green, .joy .mobile, .office, .science, .space, and
<a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">many more</a>.</li>
<li>Included in those are <strong>ccTLD</strong>s, or <strong>country code top level domains</strong>. For
example:
<ul>
<li><strong>.kr</strong> for South Korea</li>
<li><strong>.ae</strong> for the United Arab Emirates</li>
<li><strong>.fr</strong> for France</li>
<li><strong>.us</strong> for United States</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each of the big branches contains smaller branches, called second level
domains. For example:
<ul>
<li>Under .com is <strong>google</strong> for <strong>google</strong>.com</li>
<li>Under .edu is <strong>uky</strong> for <strong>uky</strong>.edu.</li>
<li>Under .org is <strong>wikipedia</strong> for <strong>wikipedia</strong>.org,</li>
<li>Under .gov is <strong>usa</strong> for <strong>usa</strong>.gov,</li>
<li>Under .apple is <strong>newsroom</strong> for <strong>newsroom.apple</strong>,</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those branches (second level domains) contain even smaller branches that are
called third level domains or subdomains. Examples include:
<ul>
<li><strong>maps</strong> for <strong>maps</strong>.google.com</li>
<li><strong>calendar</strong> for <strong>calendar</strong>.uky.edu</li>
<li><strong>en</strong> for <strong>en</strong>.wikipedia.org</li>
<li><strong>analytics</strong> for <strong>analytics</strong>.usa.gov</li>
<li><strong>www</strong> for <strong>www</strong>.uky.edu</li>
<li><strong>ci</strong> for <strong>ci</strong>.uky.edu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can take advantage of this organization
by limiting (or focusing) queries to results
within smaller sections of the web. In Google, this would entail using
what is called the <code>site:</code> operator.
We can add the <code>site:</code> operator to our search queries.
For example, let's say I do a search for the term <strong>flu</strong>, and
I notice that most of the results
that I'm interested in are from <strong>.gov</strong> domains,
and most of the results I am less interested in
are from <strong>.com</strong> domains.
To focus on the gov domains,
I add the site operator to my query.
This is the Google query I could use to search
for the topic <strong>flu</strong> only on <strong>.gov</strong> sites:</p>
<pre><code>flu site:gov
</code></pre>
<p>Then perhaps I find these results too general still.
For example, let's say I live in Kentucky but Google
keeps showing me <strong>.gov</strong> sites from other states.
We can focus on just a smaller branch of the tree.
E.g., if I wanted to focus only on results from Kentucky, then:</p>
<pre><code>flu site:kentucky.gov
</code></pre>
<p>This works because <a href="https://www.kentucky.gov">https://www.kentucky.gov</a>
exists as a website.</p>
<p>Or I can specify a part of Kentucky's government, like
the <em>Cabinet for Health and Family Services</em> or
the <em>Kentucky Department of Education</em>,
both of which exist on <strong>ky.gov</strong> domains.
with these queries:</p>
<pre><code>flu site:chfs.ky.gov
flu site:education.ky.gov
</code></pre>

<h2 id="constructing-queries-for-precise-results"><a class="header" href="#constructing-queries-for-precise-results">Constructing queries for precise results</a></h2>
<p>There are more tips and tricks
we can apply to revise and make our queries more precise.
Below I cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>using quotes around search terms for precision</li>
<li>limiting results to specific dates</li>
<li>excluding results with specific terms or phrases</li>
<li>varying the order of terms</li>
<li>using the <strong>OR</strong> keyword to specify one term, another term, or both terms</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-quotes-around-our-search-terms"><a class="header" href="#use-quotes-around-our-search-terms">Use quotes around our search terms</a></h3>
<p>With a search like <code>flu site:gov</code>,
Google provided us with snippets of text
that highlighted where the term <strong>flu</strong> appears
in the web pages that are retrieved.
For example, we see terms like these in the search results:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>flu symptoms</em></li>
<li><em>flu activity</em>,</li>
<li><em>flu vaccines</em>, and</li>
<li><em>flu season</em>.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/5-image-2.png"
alt="Google result snippets"
title="Google result snippets">
<figcaption>Fig. 2: Google result snippets</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This gives us important information
about how Google sees the text on web pages,
and we can use this information to revise our search.
For example, let's say I'm interested in web pages
that contain info about <strong>flu vaccines</strong> and
less interested in pages that contain information on
<strong>flu activity</strong> or <strong>flu season</strong>.
If that's the case, then I can add the additional term
to my query and enclose the whole query in quotation marks.
That will force Google to rank pages
with the literal term <strong>"flu vaccines"</strong>
much higher than pages with those other terms or phrases,
or exclude those other pages altogether.
So our query will now look like this
(note: only the query terms,
and not the <em>site</em> operator, are quoted):</p>
<pre><code>"flu vaccines" site:gov
</code></pre>
<p>By enclosing our query in quotes,
we force the two terms (flu and vaccines)
to be adjacent and in order:
the term flu precedes the term vaccines.</p>
<h3 id="get-more-recent-pages"><a class="header" href="#get-more-recent-pages">Get more recent pages</a></h3>
<p>If I'm really interested only in recent pages,
I can click on the <strong>Tools</strong> button and select
<strong>Any time, Past hour, Past 24 hours, Past week</strong>, or etc,
to limit results to certain time periods.</p>
<h3 id="exclude-results-with-the-minus-sign"><a class="header" href="#exclude-results-with-the-minus-sign">Exclude results with the minus sign</a></h3>
<p>Let's take a look at our flu vaccine search.
Instead of enclosing <strong>"flu vaccines"</strong> in quotes
to return only pages with that phrase and
to reduce pages retrieved with other phrases,
I could exclude the other phrases altogether
(i.e., <strong>activity</strong> and <strong>season</strong>)
by excluding them with a minus sign.
To exclude the terms <strong>activity</strong> and <strong>season</strong>
from our search results,
this is how our search would look:</p>
<pre><code>flu -activity -season site:gov
</code></pre>
<p>I can also exclude specific domains or specific websites:</p>
<pre><code>flu vaccines -site:com
flu vaccines -site:webmd.com
</code></pre>
<p>By excluding domains,
I may want the search results to
include websites from .gov, .edu, .org, etc.
but just not .com or webmd.com.</p>
<h3 id="term-order-matters"><a class="header" href="#term-order-matters">Term order matters</a></h3>
<p>Results will be different depending
on the order of the query terms.
Google has gotten good over the years about natural language
(how we talk in real life),
especially as generative artificial technologies
have become more mainstream and
integrated into search.
So the suggestion is to use natural language in your query.
For example, it's generally better to use
the search terms <strong>flu vaccine</strong> instead of <strong>vaccine flu</strong>,
since the former is how we'd phrase the terms in English.
This will of course vary by language.
In many Romance languages, but also others,
it's common (but varies) for the modifier
to come after the word being modified.
For example, in Spanish, we would say <strong>shirt red</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>camisa roja
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, a Spanish speaker
would want to search for <code>camisa roja</code>
and not <code>roja camisa</code>.
This of course is regardless of the country of origin,
but note that Google has separate landing pages for
Google.com depending on the country you're located in.
For example, for those residing in Mexico, <strong>google.com</strong>
directs to <strong>google.com.mx</strong>,
where <strong>mx</strong> is the ccTLD for Mexico:
<a href="https://www.google.com.mx/">Google Search - Mexico</a>.
For those residing in Canada, it's <strong>google.ca</strong>.</p>
<p>Although term order can determine meaning
or reflect natural language,
we can pair some terms together as lists,
without any impact on meaning or natural language.
How we pair them might change the results retrieved, though,
which becomes noticeable as we scan the search results lists.
For example, consider the following two searches:</p>
<pre><code>google bing
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>bing google
</code></pre>
<p>The above two search queries are semantically equivalent
(they mean the same thing) and their order is arbitrary in our list, but
search engines implicitly place a priority on term order.
The first term in the query is prioritized over the second term.
So if you search Google using the above two queries,
the first page of results might be mostly the same, but
as you page through them, you might see more pages on Google
than on Bing, for the first search,
and vice versa for the second search.</p>
<h3 id="one-or-the-other-or-both"><a class="header" href="#one-or-the-other-or-both">One OR the other OR both</a></h3>
<p>When we search using multiple terms,
we can use the <code>OR</code> operator to tell Google to return pages
with either of the terms or both of the terms.
Consider the following two searches:</p>
<pre><code>"google" "bing"
google OR bing
</code></pre>
<p>The first search will return pages with both
the terms included in the results
because the quotes enforce that.</p>
<p>The second search will return pages with
either the term <strong>google</strong> in the results,
the term <strong>bing</strong> in the results,
or both the terms in the results.
Note also, based on my personal experience,
that if I test the second search in
Google Search and also in Bing Search, then
Google will return more results about Google,
and Bing will return more results about Bing,
respectively.</p>
<h3 id="other-operators"><a class="header" href="#other-operators">Other operators</a></h3>
<p>There are other operators we can use in search engines, and
many of them work regardless of which search engine we use.
Here are some examples that you can test in Google or elsewhere:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>:related</strong> to find related sites
<ul>
<li><code>related:twitter.com</code></li>
<li><code>related:instagram.com</code></li>
<li><code>related:whitehouse.gov</code></li>
<li><code>related:google.com</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>:filetype</strong> to return results in specific types of files:
<ul>
<li>search <strong>uky.edu</strong> for the term <strong>flu vaccine</strong> but only retrieve <strong>PDFs</strong>:
<ul>
<li><code>flu vaccines filetype:pdf site:uky.edu</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>same as above but only return Microsoft Word files:
<ul>
<li><code>flu vaccines filetype:docx site:uky.edu</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>same idea as above but only return Microsoft Excel files:
<ul>
<li><code>birth weight filetype:xlsx site:gov</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion-5"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-5">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Information retrieval or web searching can be complex but fun.
Remember the three principals we stared with in this section,
and apply those principals when constructing your queries.</p>
<ul>
<li>document centered
<ul>
<li>consider the text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>no document is an island
<ul>
<li>consider the document with respect to the corpus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the web is organized
<ul>
<li>take advantage of the how the web is structured with <em>site</em> searches</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember and practice the techniques I discussed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>query construction
<ul>
<li>use quotes to force exact matches</li>
<li>exclude terms with the minus sign</li>
<li>term order matters</li>
<li>use OR to select alternate terms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you forget anything, use advanced search:
<a href="https://www.google.com/advanced_search">https://www.google.com/advanced_search</a></p>
<p>Or Advanced Image Search:
<a href="https://google.com/advanced_image_search">https://google.com/advanced_image_search</a></p>
<p>Google provides a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en">list of some of these operators</a>.</p>
<p>Other search engines also have search operators, and often they're the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/">DuckDuckGo</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="ps"><a class="header" href="#ps">P.S.</a></h2>
<p>You can get very advanced with your queries.
Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>trade ("surplus" OR "deficit") (site:whitehouse.gov OR site:congress.gov)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, limit to specific filetypes:</p>
<pre><code>trade ("surplus" OR "deficit") (site:whitehouse.gov OR site:congress.gov) filteype:pdf
</code></pre>
<p>The last search query is so complicated that it
decomposes into the following separate queries but
searches them all at the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>trade surplus site:whitehouse.gov filetype:pdf</code></li>
<li><code>trade surplus site:congress.gov filetype:pdf</code></li>
<li><code>trade deficit site:whitehouse.gov filetype:pdf</code></li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="database-information-retrieval"><a class="header" href="#database-information-retrieval">Database Information Retrieval</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction-3"><a class="header" href="#introduction-3">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>I introduced the concept of databases in
<a href="3a-information-sources-resources.html">section 3.1</a>.
Academic databases, or sometimes bibliographic databases,
offer a number of unique advantages over search engines,
and some disadvantages, too.
The main advantages are that databases offer
specialized collections on a variety of topics;
they offer many sources that are invisible to search engines; and
they provide greater control over the search process.
The main disadvantage is that they are a bit complicated to use well,
there are many databases to choose from (and find),
they have their own user interfaces, and
they are often only accessible via a library.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many databases are only accessible via a library
because a library pays to use them.
Google and other search engines operate on different
revenue models, like serving ads, to pay for locating <strong>free</strong> content on the web.
Google and other search engines do not provide access to <strong>non-free</strong> content on the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Information retrieval (search) in databases works
similarly and differently than it does with the web.
Like with the web,
database information retrieval works on <strong>documents</strong> in a <strong>corpus</strong>.
We search that corpus using queries, and
how we construct our queries is important.</p>
<p>Documents in databases though are a bit different.
As discussed in the previous section,
websites exist in a fairly organized hierarchy
(with respect to top level domains, etc.), but
web pages themselves are not always very structured.
Instead, search engines have become really good at taking
all that unstructured text and making sense of it.</p>
<p>Academic databases, on the other hand,
generally work with fairly structured documents;
that is, they index structured bibliographic records,
like the one in Figure 1 below.
While they may also index full text documents if those
documents are accessible to the database,
the focus is on bibliographic records.
If only bibliographic records are indexed,
the database is usually called an
<strong>abstract and indexing database (A&amp;I database)</strong>.
Otherwise it's called a full text database
if it provides full text.
Many of the databases that we have access to at our
library are a mix of the two.</p>

are metadata about specific items
(books, articles, photos, etc.)
in a bibliographic or academic database.
Metadata is broadly defined as <strong>data about data</strong>,
or sometimes as information about information.
For example, a <strong>title</strong> of a book is
metadata about the name of a book.
The <strong>author</strong> name of a journal article is
metadata about the author of a journal article.
And so forth.
The metadata about a specific item
such as a book or journal article
is a <strong>record</strong>.
In a database, this metadata is created
by professionals and is well structured
(as illustrated in Figure 1 above).
As searchers, this means
that there are pre-set fields that
we can search in academic databases and that
these pre-set fields specifically search the
corresponding metadata.
For example, in <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/4">Academic Search Complete (ASC)</a>,
we can search the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Author</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Subject Terms</li>
<li>Abstract text</li>
<li>Author supplied keywords</li>
<li>Geographic terms</li>
<li>People (names)</li>
<li>Journal Name</li>
<li>ISBN</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also filter by publication date, full text availability,
document type, language, number of pages, and images
(depending on the database and its content).
In the end, this means we have greater control over
the search process than we do in a search engine
because the corpus is better defined.</p>
<p>In the previous section on web information retrieval,
I showed how we can search the web
by using the <code>:filetype</code> operator to limit results
to PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, etc files.
In a bibliographic database like <em>ASC</em>,
we can limit results by <strong>document type</strong>.
That means we can restrict results to document types like:</p>
<ul>
<li>articles</li>
<li>bibliographies</li>
<li>book chapters</li>
<li>book reviews</li>
<li>case studies</li>
<li>editorials</li>
<li>film reviews</li>
<li>interviews</li>
<li>letters</li>
<li>obituaries</li>
<li>opinions</li>
<li>poems</li>
<li>recipes</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all the same principles apply to searching
databases as searching the web with a search engine.
Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Document-centered (bibliographic records are documents)</li>
<li>Documents exist within a corpus</li>
<li>Query construction is important</li>
</ol>
<p>And many of the same techniques apply, too:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can use <strong>quoting</strong> to make sure words are included in the results</li>
<li>Term order matters</li>
<li>We can use <strong>OR</strong> between terms to focus on one term or the other or both</li>
<li>We can use other operators, like <strong>NOT</strong> to exclude documents that contain
specific terms, and <strong>AND</strong> to force return documents that contain specific
terms.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>AND</strong> operator between two query terms means
that both terms must be present for each result in a search.
For example, if I search for <code>dogs AND cats</code> in a database
like <em>ASC</em>,
then each result must include both the terms <strong>dogs</strong> and <strong>cats</strong>.
We usually have to specify this <strong>AND</strong> in a database.
This not the case with Google and other search engines.
In search engines, the <strong>AND</strong> is assumed between terms.
So the equivalent search in, for example,
Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc is simply <code>dogs cats</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="subject-terms-and-thesauri"><a class="header" href="#subject-terms-and-thesauri">Subject Terms and Thesauri</a></h2>
<p>Many (but not all) databases offer the ability
to search by subject or thesauri term.
Subject/thesauri terms are kinds of controlled vocabulary,
but are basically special keywords assigned to bibliographic records.
If a database uses these kinds of vocabulary terms,
it means that each record in the database includes a list of
these terms that should well describe the contents
of the item it describes.
Further, this means that all bibliographic records
that share a specific subject term are linked together.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>ASC</em> database uses <strong>subject terms</strong>.
One subject term is <strong>Forest animals</strong>, and
if I use that as my search query,
then each record that is returned
must include that subject term,
and that record should match the contents of the item.
I can peruse the results and identify other subject terms
that help narrow my results.
For example, the subject term <strong>BIRD habitats</strong> appears
in records with the subject term <strong>Forest animals</strong>,
since records often have multiple subject terms.
If I combine those terms with an <strong>AND</strong> operator,
then I narrow my results down to two journal articles,
which is pretty precise.
<em>ASC</em> is a multi-disciplinary database, and
so feel free to explore subject terms related
to your own interests.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subject terms, thesauri terms, controlled vocabularly, and so forth are all
ways that professionals, like librarians, use to describe works. In the web
information retrieval section, I discussed how search engines have become
good at interpreting natural language queries. However, subject terms are
generally shorter and use more formal syntax than natural language. This is
important to know when using these terms to search academic databases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="browsing"><a class="header" href="#browsing">Browsing</a></h2>
<p>Although database search can be more precise
than using search engines,
databases are also good for browsing.</p>
<p>We all browse
(online, in stores, as we page through books, and so on)
but as a type of search process,
browsing can be a highly useful tool
when applied systematically and strategically.
The result is not simply a way to scan through search results.
Rather, the result of intentional browsing,
(reading or skimming a list of titles and abstracts)
can be the accumulation of highly relevant source material,
relevant to our information needs and queries.</p>
<h3 id="browsing-strategies"><a class="header" href="#browsing-strategies">Browsing Strategies</a></h3>
<p>Although we make a distinction
between browsing and searching,
it is oftentimes helpful to begin
a browsing session with a keyword search,
and then use something from the search results,
something like an author's name or subject term,
to find and collect related information.
We call this type of browsing <strong>pearl growing</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="subject-browsing"><a class="header" href="#subject-browsing">Subject Browsing</a></h3>
<p>Below is an image of the <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/">ERIC Database</a>.
<em>ERIC</em> stands for <strong>Education Resources Information Center</strong>.
It is provided by the U.S. Department of Education, and
it is an important access point for millions of bibliographic
records to journal articles, books, research reports,
white papers, government and other
organizational reports, and more on education related topics.</p>

<p><em>ERIC</em>, like other bibliographic databases,
offers a thesaurus of controlled terms to help aid search.
For example, let's say I'm interested in research on academic libraries.
In this screen shot, I'm looking at the page that describes
the thesaurus <strong>descriptor</strong> for <strong>academic libraries</strong>.
As is usual with thesauri,
it not only describes how the term is defined in the database,
but it also links to related terms,
including terms that are <strong>conceptually broader</strong> than academic libraries,
<strong>conceptually narrower</strong> than academic libraries,
or that are <strong>conceptually related</strong> to academic libraries.
I can click on any of these terms,
and then click on the link that says to
<strong>Search collection using this descriptor</strong>.
And in doing so, I engage in subject browsing.</p>

<h3 id="author-browsing"><a class="header" href="#author-browsing">Author Browsing</a></h3>
<p>I can browse using other <strong>access points</strong>
(a way to gain access to information)
like author names.
After perusing the results from above,
I can click on an author's name to narrow results.</p>

<p>Knowing that authors tend to write and research
on a specific range of topics (i.e., are specialists) is helpful
because it allows me to browse by author and subject topic.</p>
<h3 id="citation-browsing"><a class="header" href="#citation-browsing">Citation Browsing</a></h3>
<p>I've described abstracting &amp; indexing (A&amp;I) databases, but
there's another special type of A&amp;I database called
a <strong>citation database</strong>.
Three useful ones available to us are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/3347">Scopus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/467">Web of Science</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> (more of a scholarly <em>search engine</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two are available via UK Libraries,
and the latter is available freely on the web.
A citation database is a database that shows
who has cited an article (as known by their database)
and provides a link to those articles that have cited an article.
Citation theory says that when any two articles
(or books, or other documents) are cited in this way,
they are more likely to be about the same thing.
In fact, this is how Google search works, in part.
Google's original <em>Page Rank Algorithm</em> posited
that if a web page links to another web page,
then the two pages are likely to be about the same topic.
Because of this theory,
we can follow citations to find more relevant articles.</p>
<p>Pictured here is a record in <em>Web of Science</em> on information literacy.
To the far right you can see that it has <strong>4 Citations</strong>.
If we click on that <strong>4 Citations</strong> link,
we can begin to browse those 4 articles or documents.
Per citation theory,
it's highly probable that those 4 citing documents
are also about information literacy;
and thus, browsing them would be of considerable
help if we were interested in reading more about information literacy.</p>

alt="WOS record of article on information literacy" 
title="WOS record of article on information literacy">
<figcaption>Fig. 6: WOS record of article on information literacy</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>After clicking on the <strong>4 Citations</strong> link,
we can see that the term <strong>information literacy</strong>
appears in the title of all four citing works.
This is good evidence for our citation theory, but
it's also a useful trick for us.</p>

<p><em>Google Scholar</em> works in much the same way.
Instead of <em>Times Cited</em>, it says <em>Cited by</em>,
and the search results default by generally listing (we think)
the most highly cited works rather than the most recent,
as is the default in <em>Web of Science</em>.
But if we click on the <em>Cited by</em> link,
we'll be taken to a page that lists
the citing articles and documents,
and like the <em>Web of Science</em> example,
it's likely that many of the citing articles
will be relevant in our search on this topic.</p>

<h3 id="combination-browsing"><a class="header" href="#combination-browsing">Combination Browsing</a></h3>
<p>Like with most other searches,
we can combine terms and use those combinations
to focus our browsing sessions.
The available combinations depend on the database we use.
Here's a screen shot of an item from the
<em>Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete (CMMC)</em> database.
I searched this database using the thesauri term
<strong>DIFFUSION of innovations</strong> AND also
the term <strong>regression</strong> in the abstract.
Basically, this tells the database
to retrieve any record tagged with the thesauri term
<strong>DIFFUSION of innovations</strong> and
where also the term <strong>regression</strong>
appears in the record's abstract.
If it contains regression in the abstract,
then the source likely used or refers to a statistical technique
called linear regression, logistic regression, or like.
Once I have this initial query,
I can begin browsing the 11 titles and
abstracts that are listed in the results.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/4b-image-9.png"

<h2 id="boolean-logic-and-or-not"><a class="header" href="#boolean-logic-and-or-not">Boolean Logic: AND, OR, NOT</a></h2>
<p>Remember that database searching is more
structured at the document level, and
that this structure is reflected
in the ability to do field searches.
In the above example, for instance,
we use two fields.
The first field is a subject term search
for the subject <strong>DIFFUSION of innovations</strong>,
and it's marked as a subject field
with the <strong>DE</strong> at the beginning.
The second field is an abstract search,
and this is shown in the drop down box
to the right of the query term.
In between these two fields is a Boolean <strong>AND</strong> operator.
The AND operator tells the database that both
query terms must be present in the results.
We've seen this <strong>AND</strong> in prior examples.</p>
<p>I've mentioned two other Boolean operators:
<strong>NOT</strong> and <strong>OR</strong>.
Many bibliographic databases offer all three.
The <strong>NOT</strong> operator instructs the database
to exclude the assigned term.
Thus, if we had chosen <strong>NOT "regression"</strong>,
then the <em>CMMC</em> database would have
returned results where the term <strong>regression</strong>
surely did NOT appear in the abstract for
records with the subject term <strong>DIFFUSION of innovation</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>OR</strong> Boolean operator is a bit tricky.
It means, basically, <em>one or the other or both</em>.
Thus, if we had used it here,
then <em>CMMC</em> would have returned all records
having the subject term <strong>DIFFUSION of innovations</strong>,
as well as those records that did or did not have
<strong>regression</strong> in the abstract.
The <strong>OR</strong> operator is more useful when querying
terms in the same search fields.
For instance, we might want to use the <strong>OR</strong>
operator to search for two different terms
that might appear in the abstract fields,
or the subject term fields,
such as the following related terms:</p>
<pre><code>DIFFUSION of innovations theory" OR
INFORMATION dissemination"
</code></pre>
<p>We can see how this plays out in the results.
In the first record in the following screenshot,
both terms appear in the subjects list.
But in the second record,
only one of the terms appears.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-browse"><a class="header" href="#how-to-browse">How to Browse</a></h3>
<p>When we browse, therefore,
we are attempting to locate key qualities from our results
or our initial results lists (e.g., authors, subjects, etc.).
These lists include the titles, the abstracts, the thesauri,
and so forth.
And these key terms will help capture what our search is <strong>about</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="developing-a-list"><a class="header" href="#developing-a-list">Developing a List</a></h2>
<p>Many databases will offer a way to create,
save, and export lists or individual records
based on browsing and searching.
This helps us easily manage the documents that
we highlight as initially important.
We can curate these lists as they grow and
our search becomes more focused.</p>
<p>Creating a list in a specific database
usually requires us to create an account on
that database.
I already have an account with EBSCOhost,
the vendor that provides the <em>CMMC</em> database
as well as many others, and
in the following screenshot,
I've already signed in to that account.
To the right of the image,
you can see a folder icon.
As I browse through records that look
relevant to my needs,
I can click on that icon and save
the result to a folder.
I can also create multiple folders
and email, download, or print the records
for later use.</p>

<p>Of course, I prefer to save records
in Zotero rather than use a database folder or list.
This way I keep the records with me even if I lose
access to the database.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-6"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-6">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In this section, we learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases and search engines are different</li>
<li>Each have advantages and disadvantages</li>
<li>Search engines are well structured at the file system level</li>
<li>Databases are well structured at the record level</li>
<li>Searching in a database means search structured bibliographic records</li>
<li>Records are structured by pre-set fields</li>
<li>Subject terms or thesauri descriptors help create precise searches</li>
<li>Systematic browsing can be a rigorous way to engage in search</li>
<li>Pearl growing is a browsing strategy that involves collecting items
based on an initial aspect of a bibliographic record. Such as as:
<ul>
<li>subject term</li>
<li>author name</li>
<li>citation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because databases search structured bibliographic records with pre-set
fields, we can create very precise queries by combining fields</li>
<li>We can combine fields using Boolean logic: AND, OR, NOT</li>
<li>We can create and save lists as we browse</li>
<li>Or we can save items to our reference manager (RM).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, don't simply browse absentmindedly.
Rather, browse with smarts: systematically and strategically.
Make the systems work for you.
And save your results in Zotero or your
chosen RM as you go.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-4"><a class="header" href="#introduction-4">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>When we're doing research or trying to learn something,
we obviously want to gather content that is true.
And so the key question is,
how do we know content is true or false, or
more or less true,
or something along those lines.
Basically, truth and veracity can have nuances that
are important to identify or disentangle within stories that
are presented about how things are in the world.
For example, it's become very common
for people in the public sphere to refer to <strong>narratives</strong>,
and to argue that someone's or some group's narratives
are either true or false.
Or more accurately, a fiction or a non-fiction.
Regardless of our political or whatever positions,
this focus on narrative is interesting and worthwhile.
It's interesting because placing information
within a narrative has ancient origins, and it's
worthwhile because it places true and false content
within some context, like a story,
which can itself be evaluated as fairly true or not
(or fiction or non-).
Essentially, this is important because
stories are central to human communication and understanding
(Fisher, 1989).</p>
<p>Before we explore this, I want to acknowledge that
you may have been taught about various existing
frameworks,
like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRAAP_test">CRAAP test</a>,
to help determine the veracity of content.
Many of these frameworks ask us to ask questions
and to check off boxes about the content itself
when evaluating information or information sources.
For example, who is the author of the content,
where is the content published,
on what platform?
What is the author's or publisher's motivation?
Is the motivation purely or mostly financial?
How does that introduce bias?
What is the date of the publication?
Is it outdated?
And so forth.</p>
<p>Those kinds of questions are important,
but they may also be insufficient in determining
some content's veracity.
What's also important to identify,
especially for content that is new or new to us,
are questions that place the content in broader context,
to fit it within an overall story that's taking place.
For example, where does some content that
we're evaluating fit within a story
someone or some group is trying to tell?
How does one group's (or author's, or publisher's, etc)
story conflict with another group's (etc.)?
Alternatively, what is the consensus among different
stories that group's tell about a thing?
How do these stories compete for public acceptance?</p>
<p>When we try to identify the story, then
new questions and frameworks open up to us.
For example, it could be the case that
the basic facts about an event are agreed upon
by various storytellers
(e.g., news articles, politicians, scientists),
but that the basic facts are presented in ways that
impact how the story of those facts are told.
Then, in those different tellings, the stories
may consequently ring true or not.
Worse, if the overall story rings false, then
it may cause doubt about the basic facts, even
if those basic facts are true.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have ways to think about stories, and
Walter Fisher (1989) identified two methods
for evaluating narratives that he called
<strong>narrative probability</strong> and <strong>narrative fidelity</strong>.
The latter concept describes how well something rings true.
For example, given what you know about
the kinds of engineering feats that people
have achieved,
does it ring true that
we have landed on the moon?</p>
<p>There's more to fidelity than that,
but let's discuss narrative probability
in more detail:</p>
<h2 id="narrative-probability"><a class="header" href="#narrative-probability">Narrative Probability</a></h2>
<p>For a story to be probable (probably true, that is),
it must satisfy three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>argumentative or structural coherence</li>
<li>material coherence</li>
<li>characterological coherence</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="argumentative-or-structural-coherence"><a class="header" href="#argumentative-or-structural-coherence">Argumentative or Structural Coherence</a></h3>
<p><em>Argumentative or structural coherence</em> speaks
to the validity of an underlying
argument in a story.
That is, good stories, whether true or not,
present a series of premises that build off each other
and that present an overall thesis or argument.
Or, stories have a structure that makes sense and,
upon close inspection, contains few holes.
You all know if a story has argumentative or structural
coherence because you have all surely watched bad movies
that fail to convince you that the movie made sense.
Sometimes this lack of structural coherence in a movie
is what makes a movie fun ("it's so bad it's great!").
But when telling stories about how things are in the world,
or how they should be, or how they will be,
it's important for the story to make sense and to be valid, logically.</p>
<h3 id="material-coherence"><a class="header" href="#material-coherence">Material Coherence</a></h3>
<p>If a story is internally consistent, what next?
As is often the case, a group (e.g., ideological ones)
may compete with another group about what should
be the dominant narrative.
In such cases, we can compare and contrast their narratives,
and doing so is testing their <em>material coherence</em>.
This is the idea that we compare and contrast stories
and note in the process whether
"important facts may be omitted,
counterarguments ignored, and
relevant issues overlooked" in the process
of comparing and contrasting them (Fisher, 1989, p. 47).
Such comparisons may happen from a bird's eye view;
for example, when Democrats or Republicans
are telling the story of the United States,
can we see what important facts each group omits,
which counterarguments each group ignores,
and which relevant issues each group overlooks?</p>
<p>These comparisons may also happen at the micro-level.
In the social and physical sciences,
scholars and researchers are engaged in a series of
discussions with each other about all sorts of theories
about the social or physical worlds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quick note on theories.
Theories are simply very rigorous explanations given the data.
These explanations generally provide an account of causality,
or of how one thing causes another.
As social and physical scientists gather data,
they develop theories (like stories) that explain the data.
As new data is analyzed,
those theories are tested.
If the theories no longer explain the additional data,
they are revised or discarded and replaced with new theories.
Some theories (like the theory of general relativity) are quite stable
(i.e., well tested),
even if they do not explain everything about things within their purview,
like gravity at the quantum level.
Other theories still walk a tight rope (like string theory),
and this is most likely because more data is needed to test them
but enough data has been analyzed for them to hold for the time being.
In the social sciences and physical sciences,
it's more common for theories to explain limited phenomenon.
These are called <strong>middle-range theories</strong>.
The <strong>diffusion of innovation</strong> theory, for example,
is a <strong>middle-range theories</strong> that
was originally devised to explain how new ideas and technology spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see these discussions among scientists and researchers
take place in the literature review
and discussion sections of journal articles.
In these sections, researchers cite and refer to others
who have completed research on a similar or the same topic.
The overall goal of these discussions
is to test or develop theories that explain some phenomenon.
Essentially, researchers in the sciences are seeking to provide
a story, based on a rigorous analysis of the data they have,
that explains some phenomenon, and
in the process of doing so, they compare and contrast
their explanations with others.
As Fisher might say, they <strong>seek important facts that may have been omitted,
counterarguments that may have been ignored, and
relevant issues that may have been overlooked</strong>.</p>
<p>Practically, we can use tools to help immerse ourselves
in these discussions.
Tools like Zotero or other reference managers aid us
in collecting sources, taking notes on those sources,
and citing those sources in papers that participate in
these ongoing discussions and contribute to this collective storytelling.
In the process of writing about the phenomenon under review,
we attempt to provide a story based on the back and forth
discussions that have taken place on the topic.
These RMs, then, basically help us to test <strong>material coherence</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="characterological-coherence"><a class="header" href="#characterological-coherence">Characterological Coherence</a></h3>
<p>Can you think of a story that doesn't have a character at all?
I can't.
Even places and things can be characters in stories.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMC_DeLorean">Delorean car</a> in the <em>Back to the Future</em> movies
is, for example, somewhat of a character in those movies.
But when people are characters,
they often behave, in movies, plays, etc., <em>characteristically</em>.
That is, they behave according to their
values, beliefs, attitudes, ideas, and words.
They behave according to who they are.</p>
<p>We don't often see movies or plays or hear stories where
people behave uncharacteristically because such stories
are generally not good.
Or if people do behave uncharacteristically,
it's usually a part of the plot
and the uncharacteristic behavior was foreshadowed
somewhere earlier in the story.
Often, when we see something coming in a movie before it's happened,
it's because the characters are playing to their character.
If we don't see something coming, then it's simply likely a
complex character, and the story supports that.</p>
<p>In any regard, stories have characters,
whether people, places, or things.
And when we investigate stories (or theories),
it's worthwhile to consider whether the characters are coherent
in this way, too.
You can put this to the test.
When thinking about big issues taking place in the world,
think about who is involved,
how they are acting,
what they are saying, etc.
Is what they are saying make sense,
per the above ideas?</p>
<h2 id="closing-the-loop"><a class="header" href="#closing-the-loop">Closing the Loop</a></h2>
<p>How does this all help you evaluate information sources?
Well, when you collect sources for a project, like a paper or something,
it's a good idea, as you collect sources, to think about the stories
that are being told around the topic,
as well as the story you want or need to tell.
The sources you collect should have
structural, material, and characterological coherence, too.
This means that in the process of collecting evidence,
if you find evidence that degrades the coherence of these things,
you need to revise your story,
just like a scientist must revise or discard their theory
in the face of contradictory or discordant evidence.</p>
<h2 id="project"><a class="header" href="#project">Project</a></h2>
<p>You can test this method yourselves.
Consider a news event that's going on as you read this.
Pick two news articles that cover the event,
from two different publications.
Choose two publications that lie on different parts
of the political spectrum.
Study those two sources, and
ask the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How are the stories structurally coherent? Or not? That is, do the stories
in the two articles make sense? Are they internally consistent?</li>
<li>How are the stories materially coherent? Or not? That is, upon comparing
them, do any of them leave out important facts? Do any of them respond to
counterarguments (or alternate explanations that fit the data)? Do any of
them overlook relevant issues?</li>
<li>Are the characters in the stories characterologically coherent? Who are the
characters in the story? Do they behave according to what we know of their
values, attitudes, beliefs, ideas, and words? Do the stories present them
counter to what we already know of these people?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion-7"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-7">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Being able to evaluate information is important, but
if we have been exposed to lessons on doing so,
we have often been presented with some kind of framework
that asks us to check the boxes to see if an information source
satisfies some pre-existing criteria.
For example, such a checklist might ask us to ask:
who are the authors?
do they have a good reputation?
is the publisher respected?
is the motive to publish based on profit?
are they selling something with the information they provide?</p>
<p>While that may be an important part of the process in evaluating information,
it's also insufficient.
A more thorough way to evaluate information is to think of the information
more broadly and holistically and how topics are presented differently based on narratives.
That is, to think of the stories that are being told,
and how the information is contextualized.
Once we see the story,
we have four methods to investigate a piece of information's credibility.
We can read <strong>laterally</strong>.
That is, we can read multiple articles on a topic and compare them.
Then we can test each stories':</p>
<ul>
<li>argumentative or structural coherence</li>
<li>material coherence, and</li>
<li>characterological coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, this method can also apply to the stories
we tell ourselves or about ourselves or about our beliefs.
It's important, that is, to evaluate the information we
believe to be true as much as it is to evaluate what others
posit to be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding lateral reading, I think services like <strong>Wikipedia</strong>, <strong>ChatGPT</strong>,
and <strong>Bard</strong> should be included in sources when reading laterally. That is,
if we want to learn more about a topic, we can look at the standard sources,
such as news articles or research articles. However, we can also refer to
<em>Wikipedia</em> or the AI chatbots to sound out what we are reading about. The
more we read about a topic from a variety of sources, the more likely we'll
get a better overview of the stories being told about the topic.</p>

<p>This is the final part
of this course, and
it's time to put your
newly acquired skills to the test.
Welcome, therefore, to the section
where you'll learn how to contribute
to one of the
largest knowledge repositories
on the internet: Wikipedia!</p>
<p>First off,
Wikipedia isn't just any website;
it has its own style, rules, and community.
We'll cover how to edit Wikipedia articles
in a way that fits with
Wikipedia's unique format and expectations.
This will help you contribute effectively
to this knowledge platform.</p>
<p>Choosing the right articles is crucial.
The articles should be on topics
that you're interested in and
where you can make a meaningful contribution.
We'll discuss strategies
to help you select
the perfect article
that aligns with your
interests and the needs
of the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>Then, it's all about research.
You have already learned some
things about searching
library databases and the web,
and going forward,
you'll learn how to use
<strong>specific library and web resources</strong>
to find reliable information
for your chosen Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll tackle
how to use your <strong>Reference Manager</strong>
to save and curate your found sources.
Organizing your research is
key to making
your Wikipedia editing
process smooth and stress-free.</p>
<p>This section isn't just about learning;
it's about making a real-world
impact by enhancing
the quality of information available
to millions of people and
contributing to the
collective knowledge of the world!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wikipedia-project-setup"><a class="header" href="#wikipedia-project-setup">Wikipedia Project: Setup</a></h1>
<p>By the end of this course,
you will edit several Wikipedia articles.
To help prepare you,
this guide provides
an introduction to contributing to Wikipedia.
While actual editing won't begin
until later in the course,
it's important to start
learning the process now
in order to plan and prepare.</p>
<p>The goal:
Wikipedia's accuracy and credibility
depend on good references in its articles.
Good references allow readers
to verify information and explore topics further.
By adding references to Wikipedia articles,
this project will also serve
as a valuable learning exercise:
it will allow you to develop your research,
critical thinking, and information evaluation skills,
all while contributing to a valuable online resource.
In short,
this project will encourage you
to draw upon all the topics
we have covered since we started this course.</p>
<h2 id="readings-4"><a class="header" href="#readings-4">Readings</a></h2>
<p>Please review the following Wikipedia

<h2 id="becoming-a-wikipedia-editor"><a class="header" href="#becoming-a-wikipedia-editor">Becoming a Wikipedia Editor</a></h2>
<p>Your task is to identify
three Wikipedia articles that
you would like to edit by
adding references to them.
Over the next few weeks,
you will search for information sources
from the library and the web
to add to these selected articles.
You will collect those sources
in your reference manager (RM),
and then later edit the Wikipedia articles
by adding these references to them.</p>
<p>To help prepare you for this,
we have covered the following topics that
will help us with our project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information sources and resources</li>
<li>Reference managers</li>
<li>Web information retrieval</li>
<li>Database information retrieval</li>
<li>Evaluating information sources</li>
</ol>
<p>Upcoming lessons will continue
coverage of specific library and web resources,
how to use them, and
how to incorporate them into your work flows.
Over the next few weeks,
you should have collected enough material to
edit the Wikipedia articles
that you identify this week.</p>
<h2 id="details"><a class="header" href="#details">Details</a></h2>
<p>For this week, your task is
to identify three Wikipedia articles to edit.
You may choose any articles, but
<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_policies">note that some articles have stricter editing policies</a></strong>.
You will analyze the article for lack of references
or articles that need more references, and
collect sources that will address those shortcomings
using the search skills and resource knowledge you have
acquired this semester.
For the main project,
you will need to add two references
to each of the three articles.
Overall, you will need to identify
three sources from the library
and three from the general web.
At the end of this semester,
in the second part of this project,
you will edit the Wikipedia articles, and
add your references to the articles
that you identified.</p>
<p>For now, your job is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account on Wikipedia (if you do not already have one).</li>
<li>Identify three Wikipedia articles that you would like to add references to.</li>
<li>Begin to collect and describe at least six sources over the course of the
next few weeks that you will use as references.
<ul>
<li>Three sources will come from the library.</li>
<li>Three sources will come from the general web.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Please review the aspects of InfoKat searching here:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="introduction-5"><a class="header" href="#introduction-5">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>We have already discussed
<a href="4b-database-information-retrieval.html">database information retrieval</a>,
and we have also <a href="3a-information-sources-resources.html">taken an initial look</a>
at UK Libraries' discovery service, <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY">InfoKat</a>.
In this section we're going to explore a bit more
the places where we can apply that knowledge.
Specifically, we will take another look at
UK Libraries,
which provides access to many millions of sources
that include books (ebooks and print books),
databases, journals, archival works, image collections,
multimedia collections, and more.</p>
<p>In this and the next section,
I'll focus on two of the most common usages of the library's resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY">InfoKat</a>: for searching books and also database offerings</li>
<li><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/az.php">Databases</a>: for searching specific database offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's worth your time to explore the UK Libraries' website
in order to learn what you have access to.
Or even, you could use Google's <code>:site</code> operator
to locate resources of interest that the library provides:</p>
<pre><code>[something of interest] site:libraries.uky.edu
</code></pre>
<p>For example,
let me point out that UK Libraries
has multiple <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/home">Research Guides</a>
that cover how to explore and conduct
research in specific areas and domains.
The site also highlights specific
librarians to contact if additional support
is needed.
Here's the Research Guide for those
interested or majoring in
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/ICT">Information Communication Technology</a>.</p>
<h2 id="infokat"><a class="header" href="#infokat">InfoKat</a></h2>
<p><em>InfoKat</em> is short for <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY">InfoKat Discovery</a>, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is the primary search tool for browsing
and finding materials from UK Libraries' collections,
and a great place to begin your research.
InfoKat searches our libraries' physical holdings
together with a majority of the
individual databases to which we subscribe
<a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/find-borrow/where-do-i-start">About InfoKat</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, it's the modern equivalent of an
online card catalog system, but
because it's modern,
it's much more than a card catalog.
Not only can InfoKat locate books on the shelves
at W.T. Young or at the other <a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/locations">library locations at UK</a>,
InfoKat is also good for discovering digital collections,
database resources, and more.
And if the library doesn't have a source,
InfoKat can facilitate an interlibrary loan request.
Although interlibrary loans mean that we
won't get immediate access to the requested source,
it's often very fast.
In my experience,
I usually receive PDF copies of
requested journal articles within 24 hours,
and for many books that I've requested through interlibrary loan,
I generally receive copies within one to three days.</p>
<p>InfoKat also works well with Zotero and
other reference management software.
I'll cover that in a follow up demonstration video.</p>
<h2 id="searching-infokat"><a class="header" href="#searching-infokat">Searching InfoKat</a></h2>
<p>There are two initial ways to search InfoKat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic search</li>
<li>Advanced search</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic search works just like how you would use
Google or some other search engine.
You enter a query into the search box and press enter.</p>
<p>However, because the <strong>corpus</strong> you're querying is structured,
like a database,
it's not necessarily advisable to use <em>natural language</em>
for your queries like you might in a web search engine.
Remember that our three principles of information retrieval:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle 1:</strong> We should understand that the basic information retrieval
model centers on <strong>documents</strong>. Anything indexed in a database or on the web
is treated as a document. Documents include text, sound, images, video, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Principle 2:</strong> We should understand that documents do not exist
independently of other documents. This is called the <strong>corpus</strong>. For the web,
the <strong>corpus</strong> is organized like a <strong>file system</strong>, much like the file system
on your personal computers. In a bibliographic database, the <strong>corpus</strong> is
organized by predefined fields such as author names, title names, subject
terms, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Principle 3:</strong> Our queries are not divorced from the <strong>documents</strong> nor the
<strong>corpus</strong> nor the <strong>organization of the corpus</strong>. These things are all
intertwined. Each time we search, search engines and databases compare
<strong>documents</strong> in the <strong>corpus</strong> to each other and to how they are organized
based on our <strong>queries</strong>, and then rank order (in some way) those documents
by way of that comparison. Hence, when we <strong>construct queries</strong>, it's useful
to think about the content (corpus)</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, queries should always consider the
corpus we're searching.
This means you should devise queries that highlight
the subject matter.
You can do this by picking one or more keywords
for your queries that express the topic
that you're interested in retrieving.
Also, because the InfoKat corpus you're searching is structured,
advanced search offers fine-tuned, precision search
functions that let us search by specific fields,
dates, and includes Boolean logic.</p>
<h3 id="basic-search"><a class="header" href="#basic-search">Basic Search</a></h3>
<p>Basic search is a great place to start your research,
especially when starting on a new project.
From there you can use hints that you see in your retrieval
results to practice
<a href="4b-database-information-retrieval.html"><em>pearl growing</em></a>
or to refine and narrow your search results.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/9-image-1.png"
alt="InfoKat basic search"
title="InfoKat basic search">
<figcaption>Fig. 1: InfoKat basic search</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>You can apply <em>pearl growing</em> by noticing title information,
subject terms, publication information, or more and
as a way to follow up on leads/hints you find in the results you retrieve.
You can also refine results by availability, resource type,
subject heading, language, and more.</p>
<p>Like web search engines,
term order matters.
Therefore, you should enclose queries in double quotes in order
to force InfoKat to return results using the exact
terminology and to return results in the same order as your terms.
For example, if my query is:</p>
<pre><code>web development
</code></pre>
<p>Then results will include titles like:</p>
<pre><code>Development of a web tool to ...
</code></pre>
<p>But if I wrap my query in quotes, like so:</p>
<pre><code>"web development"
</code></pre>
<p>Then results will literally reflect those terms and in that order.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>Hands-On Full Stack Web Development with Angular...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="advanced-search"><a class="header" href="#advanced-search">Advanced Search</a></h3>
<p>Advanced search in InfoKat provides a form
where you can focus on constructing precise queries.
You can apply a variety of search filters that
limit queries to specific fields in the structured data,
such as title information, author/creator information, and subject terms.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/9-image-2.png"
alt="InfoKat advanced search"
title="InfoKat advanced search">
<figcaption>Fig. 2: InfoKat advanced search</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>Instead of using double quotes to force results to match your query,
you have other options.
These include the ability to state whether the search results should
contain the terms in your query, match exactly the terms in your query,
which is like using double quotes, or
whether the search results should start with the same terms
as your query.</p>
<p>You can also use Boolean logic in advanced search.
This is especially helpful as you refine your queries.
For example, if you're interested in web development
but not interested in "embedded web development",
you can use the Boolean <strong>NOT</strong> to removed retrieved records that
contain the word "embedded" from the results.
You can also limit results by time period (publication date)
in order to focus on either historical works or recent works.</p>
<p>If you're using Zotero and the browser add-on,
you will see a folder icon in your browser bar
when you're on the result page.
This will let you save multiple items to your Zotero
library or to a specific Zotero folder in your library.</p>
<h2 id="record-page"><a class="header" href="#record-page">Record Page</a></h2>
<p>When you find a result that interests you,
click on the link to get more information and
do more with the result.
From here you can save the specific item to Zotero,
but InfoKat let's you export citations manually, too.
You can have the item emailed to you, or print them out,
and more.</p>
<p>If the item is available as a print item,
InfoKat will tell you where in the library it's located
(i.e., shelf and floor), and
it will also tell you which library the book is located,
since UK Libraries has many locations aside from W.T. Young.
If the item is not available electronically or in print
at one of the UK Library locations,
this is where you can request the items via interlibrary loan.</p>
<p>When you sign in via your linkblue information,
you can request the item directly, and if you have
loans out, you can request that they be renewed.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-8"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-8">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>UK Libraries provides access to millions of items
in both digital and print versions.
In this section, I focused on accessing their collections
using InfoKat Discovery,
and we focused on using Basic and Advanced Search.</p>
<p>It's fine to know the basics of a technology like InfoKat,
but it's another level to integrate this technology into your workflow.
In order to do that,
you should use Zotero, or your reference manager of choice,
to save items to you Zotero library.
As you save items,
return to them, read them, and take notes on them.
This process will become streamlined and feel natural over time,
and eventually you'll have amassed your own personal knowledge repository.</p>
<p>In the next section, I'll focus on specific databases
that UK Libraries provides access to for more topical searches.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="library-sources-part-2"><a class="header" href="#library-sources-part-2">Library Sources: Part 2</a></h1>
<p>UK Libraries provides access to many millions of sources
that include books (ebooks and print books),
databases, journals, archival works, image collections,
multimedia collections, and more.
In the prior section,
I focused on using Infokat to search some of these collections.
In this section, I focus on a handful of the
databases that UK Libraries offers.</p>
<p>I can only focus on a handful of databases
because UK Libraries,
as a major research institution and because of its
large student body and wide range of majors,
provides access to 734 total databases
(as of spring 2024).
Many of these databases are specialized
(e.g., African American and Africana Studies, Appalachian Studies)
or cover a broad general research area (e.g., Chemistry, Education).
But a few are designed to be super broad;
that is, they are databases of databases.
I've already covered <em>Academic Search Complete</em> in prior sections,
which is one example of a database of databases.
In this section, I'll cover another one plus some
citation databases.</p>
<p>Remember that if you have desktop Zotero
plus the Zotero browser add-on installed,
Zotero will automatically recognize when you have a
web page open for a specific item in of these databases.
Thus, use Zotero when examining these databases
to collect information on your Wikipedia topic.</p>
<p>While I will only cover a few databases in this section,
I encourage you to explore all that's offered.
To access the databases,
you can browse the list on UK Libraries' website:</p>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/az.php">A-Z Databases</a></p>
<p>You can also search that list using
topical keywords in the search box,
you can limit results to specific subject areas, and
you can focus on <em>database types</em>.
Like <em>document types</em> in the <em>ASC</em> database,
database types indicate something about the source.
Potential types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio/Video</li>
<li>Digitize primary sources</li>
<li>E-book collections</li>
<li>Government documents</li>
<li>Image collections, and more.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="factiva"><a class="header" href="#factiva">Factiva</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/720"><em>Factiva</em></a> is a helpful database for locating news,
market, and company information.
You can search against subjects, industries, within regions, and
you can add other limits.
There are a slew of some advanced search operators that
help power up your search.
You can <a href="http://factiva.com/CP_Developer/ProductHelp/FDK/FDK38/search_factiva/query_expressions/search_statement_operators.htm">read through the list of operators</a> and
field codes to use when searching <em>Factiva</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/10-image-2.png"
alt="Factiva Search Builder"
title="Factiva Search Builder">
<figcaption>Fig. 2: Factiva Search Builder</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>We can try an example search.
Let's say I'm interested in any news about
Google and open source software.
To search this in <em>Factiva</em>,
I can approach the query simply, like so
(being sure to wrap <em>open source</em> in quotes):</p>
<pre><code>"open source" AND google 
</code></pre>
<p>This search was conducted on Aug 1, 2022, and
you can see there are 4,244 results.</p>
<p>On the left side you can see a distribution of articles
by date of publication,
a list of relevant companies that appear
in the documents that were retrieved,
as well as lists of sources, subjects, industries,
languages, regions, and so forth.</p>
<p>If I wanted to export any of these documents,
I can click on specific check boxes and
export the results in various ways,
either as RTF or a PDF files,
or have it email the results to me or print them.
We can look at the publication data distribution and
note whether there are more results on a
given day than on others.
This may suggest a hot news day for this particular topic and
that may be something we want to explore.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the search builder.
Say I found that the previous set of results
were hit or miss and, as a result,
I want to refine my search.
Now I can try the <strong>adjacent operator</strong>.
The adjacent operator tells the database to only return documents
where the query terms appear within a
set amount of space between each other.
The assumption is that the closer any terms are to each other,
the more likely the document will be about those terms.
Thus, if I replace the <strong>and</strong> operator with the <strong>adj5</strong> operator,
I ask <em>Factiva</em> to return documents where the term <em>open source</em>
is within five words of the term <em>Google</em>:</p>
<pre><code>"open source" adj5 google
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the results are much different than the previous one.
Here I only have 205 results.
The list of companies have also changed, and more.
If we investigate any of these documents,
you and confirm that our two terms,
which are highlighted,
appear within five words of each other
in all the results.</p>
<p>As stated,
there are <a href="http://factiva.com/CP_Developer/ProductHelp/FDK/FDK38/search_factiva/query_expressions/search_statement_operators.htm">many operators in Factiva</a>
besides <strong>adj[N]</strong>.
At that link, you can see that the standard Boolean
operators are available: <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>, <strong>not</strong>.
There are more proximity and other operators, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>w/N</strong></li>
<li><code>"open soruce" w/5 google</code></li>
<li>like the <code>adj</code> operators</li>
<li><strong>same</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>"open source" same google</code></li>
<li>terms must appear in same paragraph</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>near[N]</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>"open source" near5 google</code></li>
<li>like <code>adj</code> but bi-directional</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>atleastN</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>atleast5 google and "open source"</code></li>
<li>'google' must appear at least 5 times in document</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that you can create an account for <em>Factiva</em>
if you want to save or export your searches.
Zotero is also capable of extracting bibliographic information
from <em>Factiva</em> and
will recognize that a source document is,
for example,
a news article or like.</p>

<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/467"><em>Web of Science (WoS)</em></a> is an abstract &amp; indexing citation database.
This means that the database does not directly provide full text access
but it does link to UK Library when full text is available for results.
As a citation database,
it also provides the number of citations each result has received,
and this is a way to find additional relevant documents.</p>
<p>The <strong>Core Collection</strong> is the default collection/database.
This is <em>Web of Sciences'</em> main database and
includes coverage of the sciences, the arts, and the humanities.
<em>WoS</em> offers other databases that mostly cover the sciences, and
you can search all of those databases at the same time, but
it's often better to focus on the core collection when starting.</p>
<p>Let's try a search. We can try our open source and Google search,
as seen in Figure 3:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/10-image-3.png"
alt="WoS search for 'open source' and google"
title="WoS search for 'open source' and google">
<figcaption>Fig. 3: <i>WoS</i> search for 'open source' and google</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>I can keep the default field search set to <strong>All Fields</strong>, or
focus on other fields, like <strong>Topic</strong>,
which searches titles, abstracts, and keywords.</p>
<p>As of August 1, 2022, this query retrieves 1,134 results.
Let's say that my search is a bit too broad still, and
I want to refine my query to narrow my results.
Just like in <em>Factiva</em>,
<em>WoS</em> offers a proximity operator called NEAR.
Let's try it out with the following query
on the <em>WoS</em> advanced search page:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/10-image-4.png"
alt="WoS advanced search for TS=("open source" NEAR google)"
title="WoS advanced search for TS=("open source" NEAR google)">
<figcaption>Fig. 4: <i>WoS</i> advanced search for TS=("open source" NEAR google)</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>Now there are only 9 results,
and if I examine the title, abstract, or keywords for the results,
I'll see that the term "google" is placed within five words of
the term "open source".
If I want to really narrow down my search,
I can change the field to <strong>Title</strong> only.</p>
<p>The default results list is to show articles
that are published more recently.
I can change this default sorting method so that
<em>WoS</em> sorts based on sources that have the highest citations first.
Once I do this, I can go to the right side,
and look at the <strong>Times Cited</strong> link and
see which articles have been cited the most.
This is what makes <em>WoS</em> a citation database.
We don't have to use <em>WoS</em> as a citation database,
but this is what separates <em>WoS</em>
from many other scholarly databases.</p>
<p>Theoretically, each one of these citing articles should be
related to the article that is cited by them. I can them peruse
these citing articles to help me find even more
relevant sources of information.</p>
<p>Instead of basic search, we can search
by author, cited reference, and more.
If you click on the big question mark button in <em>WoS</em>,
you'll find a guide on how to use <em>WoS</em>.
The guide includes some tips on the use of various search operators,
including the <em>NEAR</em> operator as well as the Boolean operators.</p>
<p>Remember that <em>Web of Science</em> doesn't offer direct access to content,
but notice that there is this <strong>Full Text @ W. T. Young</strong> link
at the bottom of some records in the search results.
This link is connected to Infokat,
which knows that if the article is available,
Infokat can retrieve it.
If not, then we can request it through interlibrary loan.
Also, in some cases there's also a link
to look up the full text in Google Scholar if the source
is freely available on the web
(this is usually called <strong>open access</strong>).</p>
<p>Remember that you can create an account for <em>WoS</em>
if you want to save your searches or create folders
(called <strong>Marked Lists</strong>) in <em>WoS</em>.
Although the vendor that provides <em>WoS</em>
is also the same vendor that provides the <em>EndNote</em> reference manager,
Zotero is also capable of extracting bibliographic information here.</p>
<h2 id="jstor-1"><a class="header" href="#jstor-1">JSTOR</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/266"><em>JSTOR</em></a> is multi-disciplinary database.
Like other databases,
you can limit results by <strong>Item Type</strong>, <strong>Language</strong>,
<strong>Publication Date</strong>, <strong>subject area</strong>, and more.
<em>JSTOR</em> also provides proximity search using the <strong>NEAR</strong> operator.</p>
<p>JSTOR covers subjects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts</li>
<li>Business &amp; Economics</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Medicine &amp; Allied Health</li>
<li>Science &amp; Mathematics</li>
<li>Security studies</li>
<li>Social Sciences, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these subject areas includes access to many journal titles, and
therefore, many journal articles.
<em>JSTOR</em> has long focused on back issues of journals, but
in recent years has made moves to include current literature and
open access content (this is content that is freely available).
The content in <em>JSTOR</em> is high quality, peer-reviewed work, which
makes <em>JSTOR</em> a great place to gather documents on a topic
that you want to research in-depth.
My <strong>"open source" and google</strong> query for Images
returns 26 results.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/10-image-8.png"
alt="JSTOR image search"
title="JSTOR image search">
<figcaption>Fig. 8: <i>JSTOR</i> Image Search</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p><em>JSTOR</em> also includes <em>ARTSTOR</em>.
which is located in the <em>JSTOR</em> images search above.
<em>ARTSTOR</em> is database of art and multimedia objects,
much of which is also available as open access.</p>
<p>Again, remember that if you have desktop Zotero
plus the Zotero browser add-on installed,
Zotero will automatically recognize when you have a
web page open for a specific item in in <em>JSTOR</em>.
Thus, you can use Zotero with <em>JSTOR</em>
to collect information on your Wikipedia topic.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-9"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-9">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>That covers <em>Factiva</em>, <em>Web of Science</em>,
<em>Google Scholar</em>, and <em>JSTOR</em>.
Remember that <em>Factiva</em> is a general-interest news database;
<em>WoS</em> and <em>Google Scholar</em> are both citation, scholarly databases
(I'll cover <em>Google Scholar</em> in the next lesson); and
<em>JSTOR</em> is a scholarly and image database.</p>
<p>In the next section,
we begin to cover web sources.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="web-sources-part-1"><a class="header" href="#web-sources-part-1">Web Sources: Part 1</a></h1>
<p>Many of us spend most of our time on the web
visiting a handful of sites.
These sites vary by country, but in the U.S.,
we spend much of our time on Google, YouTube,
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Netflix, TikTok,
Wikipedia, and a few others.</p>
<p>That's fine, of course, but
the web is composed of billions of web pages,
and many are worth knowing and exploring.</p>
<p>We also spend most of our time on a limited number of domains.
This includes sites ending with <strong>.com, .org, .edu</strong>, etc.
But remember that you've already learned how to search the web,
and if you're interested in learning more about what's out there,
I encourage you to add a <code>:site</code> operator to your web queries
if you want to vary things up every once in a while.
Remember that there nearly <a href="https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">1,500 top level domains</a>,
and it can be fun to add random ones to your searches:</p>
<pre><code>asthma site:health
(linux or windows or macos) site:computer
</code></pre>
<p>That said, in this and the next section I want to cover a
few specific sites that are great information resources.</p>
<h2 id="google-scholar"><a class="header" href="#google-scholar">Google Scholar</a></h2>
<p>Let's try <a href="https://scholar.google.com"><em>Google Scholar</em></a> now.
<em>Google Scholar</em> isn't technically a library database
since it's freely accessible on the web, but
I will show you how to connect it to Infokat so
that it functions like <em>WoS</em> or other databases that we've covered.</p>
<p><em>Google Scholar</em> doesn't have the kind of search operators
that either <em>Factiva</em> or <em>Web of Science</em> have, but
it's a freely available citation database that indexes a lot of content.
In Google and related search products,
like <em>Google Scholar</em>, the <strong>AND</strong> operator does not
need to be specified.
Thus the following search is translated as:
<strong>"open source" AND google</strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="images/10-image-5.png"
alt="Google Scholar search for "open source" google"
title="Google Scholar search for "open source" google">
<figcaption>Fig. 5: <i>Google Scholar</i> search for "open source" google</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>You can see here we get a lot of results.
Maybe even too much.
If we want to limit our results,
we have to use other tricks.
The most common one is simply to add
more specific keywords to our query.
E.g., if I add "android" to the query,
that reduces the results.</p>
<pre><code>"open source" google android
</code></pre>
<p>There is an advanced search option.
However, since <em>Google Scholar</em> is indexing full text sources
and not structured bibliographic records,
this means that it can't offer the kind of advanced
search we've seen in database searches.
It is pretty useful, though.
For example, Figure 6 shows an advanced search for the terms
<strong>google</strong> and <strong>"open source"</strong> but it
excludes the term <strong>android</strong> in the title,
and it asks for results published from 2018 to today.
You can see that this substantially narrows our results.
As of August 1, 2022, <em>Google Scholar</em> returns only 35 hits
and 71 hits as of March 2024.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/10-image-6.png"
alt="Google Scholar search for "open source" google not android in title"
title="Google Scholar search for "open source" google not android in title">
<figcaption>Fig. 6: <i>Google Scholar</i> search for "open source" google not android in title</figcaption> 
</figure>
<p>Other than that, one of the nice things about
<em>Google Scholar</em> is that it's also a citation database.
You can see the <strong>Cited by N</strong> link just below each result.
If something has been cited,
click on that to follow citations.</p>
<p>The reason <em>Google Scholar</em> returns so many more results is
because it casts a bigger net than something like
<em>Web of Science</em> does,
which purposefully casts a smaller net,
which is smaller to control for quality.
Because of that, I find <em>Google Scholar</em> can return
many non-relevant works, but
it makes it nice for browsing or discovery.
<em>Web of Science</em> shines for more
rigorous and methodical literature searches.</p>
<p>The observant among you may have noticed that in Figure 5,
there is a <strong>View Now @ UK</strong> link.
The reason <em>Google Scholar</em> provides that link is that
I've configured it to talk with UK's Infokat.
This is something you have to set up, but
it's pretty simple to do.
Just click on settings,
and then go to <strong>Library Links</strong>, and
then search for the University of Kentucky.
Check the box next to it.
Be sure that you're signed into Google
if you want to save this as a preference.
After that,
you should see the <strong>View Now</strong> option when something is
available via UK Libraries.</p>

<p>You might find the following three other web-based bibliographic tools useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossref</strong> <a href="https://search.crossref.org/">https://search.crossref.org/</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Crossref</em> will search all works that have a DOI, or [digital object identifier][doi]. As such, it contains many millions of bibliographic records.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Semantic Scholar</strong> <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/">https://www.semanticscholar.org/</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Semantic Scholar</em> is an AI powered bibligraphic search engine that also functions as a citation database. It can provide summaries of articles and other works, lists of citations, citing authors, co-authors of authors, and links to related papers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consesus</strong> <a href="https://consensus.app/search/">https://consensus.app/search/</a>
<ul>
<li><em>Consensus</em> build on <em>Semantic Scholar</em>. Instead of a functioning like a traditional search engine, you can ask it questions on research topics. It provides examples on its main search page. It provide citation information and details about studies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internet-archive"><a class="header" href="#internet-archive">Internet Archive</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> is a "non-profit library
of millions of free books, movies, software, music,
websites, and more."</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in playing
some old PC games that your parents played
when they were younger:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/classicpcgames?and%5B%5D=subject%3A%22DOS+games%22">Classic PC Games</a></p>
<p>The <em>Internet Archive</em> provides access to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>.
The Wayback Machine is an archive of the web from its early days
to the present.
It's fun, for example, to use it to see what the web
looked like years ago.
For example, this is likely UK's first web page and
was captured by the <em>Wayback Machine</em> in 1997:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970406042950/http://www.uky.edu/">http://www.uky.edu/ (1997)</a></p>
<p>But the <em>Wayback Machine</em> is also useful to retrieve
web pages and sites that have been shutdown or removed.
That is, if you have a broken URL,
you can enter the URL in the Wayback Machine and
see if the original page was archived.</p>
<p>The <em>Internet Archive</em> is also a library, and
offers collections on a vast range of topics and links
to all sorts of media,
including text, audio, video, and images.</p>
<p>You can view its main collections on the
home page of the <em>Internet Archive</em>.
You can also search.
I've found, for instance, scanned yearbooks from my college.</p>
<p>The <em>Internet Archive</em> oversees <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">The Open Library</a>.
You can use the <em>Open Library</em> to check out and read books for free,
just like you would use a physical library.</p>
<h2 id="dpla"><a class="header" href="#dpla">DPLA</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://dp.la">DPLA</a> (Digital Public Library of America)
is a shared repository of content
that brings together digital and digitized sources
from libraries, museums, and archives across the U.S.</p>
<p>The DPLA is great for browsing, but they also
<a href="https://dp.la/guides">provide guides for those interested in using the DPLA</a>
for Education, Family Research, Lifelong Learning, and
Scholarly Research.</p>
<p>Like a library, museum, or archive,

<p>The <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/index.html">Library of Congress</a> provides a list of
bibliographies, research guides, and finding aids
on a vast range of topics.
Many of the links in this list go directly to
digital libraries that focus on specific topics or areas.
For example, check out this fun collection of resources
on <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/dance-instruction-manuals-from-1490-to-1920/about-this-collection/">dance manuals</a> published from 1490 through 1920.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress also provides access to
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/">digital collections</a> on subjects ranging from
<strong>American History</strong>, <strong>War &amp; Military</strong>,
<strong>Art &amp; Architecture</strong>, <strong>Sports &amp; Recreation</strong>,

<h2 id="various-government-resources"><a class="header" href="#various-government-resources">Various Government Resources</a></h2>
<h3 id="us-census"><a class="header" href="#us-census">U.S. Census</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/">United States Census Bureau</a> is the best
way to get various demographic and some economic
information about the U.S.
You can also get <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045221">Quick Facts</a>
about your local area.
You can, for example, also compare demographics by location.
Here's a
<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/cincinnaticityohio,lexingtonfayetteurbancountykentucky,US/PST045221">population comparison between Lexington, KY and Cincinnati, OH</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nasa"><a class="header" href="#nasa">NASA</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA's</a> website offers tons of sources on all
of its major projects.
From its homepage,
you can download apps, audio &amp; ringtones,
e-books, and podcasts.
The site also provides information on various missions,
like the recent <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/webb/main/index.html">James Webb Space Telescope</a>
as well as exciting <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html">image</a> and
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html">video</a> galleries.</p>
<h3 id="us-bureau-of-labor-statistics"><a class="header" href="#us-bureau-of-labor-statistics">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> is the
go to site for job and economic information.
The site takes some exploration to learn all that it offers,
but I can provide two examples.</p>
<p>The Data Tools dropbox box provides employment change
data for various sectors of the U.S.
As of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/otm-employment-change-by-industry-confidence-intervals.htm">March 2024</a>, we see that manufacturing jobs
in the U.S. decreased by an estimated 4,000,
government jobs increased by an estimated 52,000, and
overall non-farm jobs increased by 275,000.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">CPI Inflation Calculator</a> shows how the value
of the dollar has changed over time.
For example, I can see that $1.00 in February of 2023
has the same buying power as $1.03 in February of 2024.</p>
<p>This calculator is useful in a lot of ways.
For example, the tuition to attend UK for the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030101090559/http://www.uky.edu/PR/News/Archives/2001/Sept2001/02tuition.htm">2002-2003 academic year was $1,740 per semester</a>, and for the
<a href="https://www.uky.edu/studentaccount/tuition-faq23-24">2023-2024 academic year, it is $6,429</a>.
The CPI calculator shows that if tuition increased
at the same rate as inflation,
then today's tuition cost should only be $3,030.18 per semester
(from January 2002 to January 2024).
That means the extra $3,398.82 spent on tuition today increased
due to other (complicated) factors.</p>
<p>You can also see how home prices have changed.
The house I rent was purchased for $101,650
during the summer of 2001.
Zillow estimates that it would sell for $317,800 (Spring 2024).
But inflation only accounts for a price tag of $177,217.
Thus the extra $140,583 or so is factor of other market forces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Property information like this is generally public information.
Fayette County, the seat of Lexington, KY, provides this information
at <a href="https://fayettepva.com/">https://fayettepva.com/</a>.
You can check your local municipality's website for comparable information.
In fact, many city and county websites make available lots of data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="edgar-us-securities-and-exchange-commission"><a class="header" href="#edgar-us-securities-and-exchange-commission">EDGAR: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml">EDGAR</a> is a go to site if you're thinking about investing
in a public company.
Of particular interest are the <strong>10-K</strong> and <strong>10-Q</strong> reports.
The <strong>10-K</strong> report is an annual report that public companies
are required to submit to the SEC.
The <strong>10-Q</strong> report is the quarterly version.</p>
<p>The <strong>10-K</strong> report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provides audited annual financial statements,
a discussion of material risk factors for the company and its business,
and a management's discussion and analysis of the company's
results of operations for the prior fiscal year
(<a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Article/edgarguide.html">Form Type Description</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>10-Q</strong> report is unaudited.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/">EDGAR search page</a> is pretty straightforward
and offers autocomplete as you type.
My search query in Figure 1 is a search
for Google's (specifically, Alphabet's) last <strong>10-K</strong> report,
which was filed on February 2, 2022.</p>

<p>If you read the 2024 report,
you can see that <em>Google</em> primarily
earns income based on advertising,
customer subscriptions,
devices (e.g., Pixel),
and Google Cloud usage.
It's working on integrating AI technologies in its core services.
It has 182,502 employees.
There is much more in this report and
similar reports from other public companies.</p>
<h2 id="medlineplus"><a class="header" href="#medlineplus">MedlinePlus</a></h2>
<p>Lastly, I would like to refer you to <a href="https://medlineplus.gov">MedlinePlus</a>,
which is part of the National Library of Medicine.
The purpose of this site is to serve as a health and medical reference
resource for the general public.
Although no online site can take the place of professional medical help,
MedlinePlus can be an important resource for becoming more
informed about various health topics.</p>
<p>Instead of <em>googling</em> that next symptom or condition,
I highly encourage you to visit MedlinePlus first.
The site also covers wellness topics and provides recipes
for a wide range of meals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-10"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-10">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Although it's important to know how to search the web well,
it's also handy to know about specific go to resources on the
web that can provide more in-depth information or
that provide more coverage than most Google etc searches can yield.
In order to highlight this, in this section I covered a few,
I think, super interesting and helpful sites that include the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Scholar
<ul>
<li>Crossref</li>
<li>Semantic Scholar</li>
<li>Consensus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internet Archive</li>
<li>Open Library</li>
<li>DPLA</li>
<li>Library of Congress</li>
<li>U.S. Census</li>
<li>NASA</li>
<li>U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</li>
<li>EDGAR (SEC)</li>
<li>MedlinePlus</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to explore these sites, as well as others you find,
because many of these just don't come up in your everyday
kind of search.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="web-sources-part-2"><a class="header" href="#web-sources-part-2">Web Sources: Part 2</a></h1>
<p>We continue this section by covering a variety of
web resources that are invaluable but that don't
necessarily show up in our everyday web searches.
Many of the web resources do not simply report information but
require visitors to generate information based on user input or
search for resources.</p>
<p>In particular, in this section, I'd like to cover
a variety of open educational resources and digital libraries.
Your education at UK should be, I hope, super beneficial,
but you won't be in college forever, and
you may have the kind of mind that wants to continue to grow
and learn and improve.
These sites may also help with various research projects, but
they're also just enlightening and educational.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the number and quality of
open educational resources has been blossoming in recent years,
and these sites offer free, online textbooks on
a vast range of subjects.</p>
<h2 id="education"><a class="header" href="#education">Education</a></h2>
<h3 id="directory-of-open-access-books"><a class="header" href="#directory-of-open-access-books">Directory of Open Access Books</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://directory.doabooks.org/">Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB)</a> provides
references to hundreds of free textbooks or scholarly works
on a wide range of topics.
It's easy to browse by topic or subject, such as
<a href="https://directory.doabooks.org/browse?type=classification_text&amp;value=Sociology">sociology</a>,
<a href="https://directory.doabooks.org/browse?type=classification_text&amp;value=Economics">economics</a>,

<a href="https://directory.doabooks.org/browse?type=classification_text&amp;value=Technology%3A+general+issues">technology</a>, and more.</p>
<h3 id="oer-commons"><a class="header" href="#oer-commons">OER Commons</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oercommons.org">OER Commons</a> is probably a bigger resource
for open educational content.
It provides access to <a href="https://www.oercommons.org/oer">subject areas</a>
ranging from applied science to education to mathematics to social sciences.
It goes beyond providing access to textbooks and also includes
access to various materials types, such as
case studies, games, data sets, lesson plans, and more.</p>
<h3 id="university-of-kentucky-libraries"><a class="header" href="#university-of-kentucky-libraries">University of Kentucky Libraries</a></h3>
<p>UK Libraries provides more links to open educational resources
and supports a program for UK faculty to create free, digital textbooks.
You can find a lot of this material on <a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/">UKnowledge</a>,
and there is an <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/alternative_textbooks/find">OER Research Guide</a> that lists

<h3 id="online-learning-platforms"><a class="header" href="#online-learning-platforms">Online Learning Platforms</a></h3>
<p>Online learning platforms
include <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, and others.
These sites offer courses on many subjects you'd find
in college but for free.
You can also pay to earn certificates or degrees.
The courses offered on these platforms are like online learning courses.
They provide lectures and online activities to work through
and to learn the material.</p>
<h2 id="digital-libraries"><a class="header" href="#digital-libraries">Digital Libraries</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the open educational resources that are available,
there are also some really interesting digital libraries that exist
and are worth exploring.</p>
<h3 id="the-national-science-digital-library"><a class="header" href="#the-national-science-digital-library">The National Science Digital Library</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://nsdl.oercommons.org/">The National Science Digital Library</a> is a digital library
that provides educational resources on STEM
(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) topics and
for all educational levels.
Topics include applied science, mathematics,
statistics and probability, trigonometry, technology,
chemistry, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="civil-rights-digital-library"><a class="header" href="#civil-rights-digital-library">Civil Rights Digital Library</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://crdl.usg.edu/?Welcome&amp;Welcome">The Civil Rights Digital Library</a> is a digital library
that provides resources on the Civil Rights Movement.
The library can be browsed by events, places, people, topics, and more.
Due to the nature of the topic,
some of the content can be disturbing or challenging,
but if you are interested in civil rights,
then this is an invaluable and necessary resource.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-york-public-library-digital-collections"><a class="header" href="#the-new-york-public-library-digital-collections">The New York Public Library Digital Collections</a></h3>
<p>The New York Public Library (NYPL) is one of the
biggest public libraries in the U.S.
with more than 25 million items in its collections.
<a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/">The New York Public Library Digital Collections</a>
is an effort by NYPL librarians to make much of that
collection accessible to the wider public.
The digital collections provide access to
"prints, photographs, maps, manuscripts, streaming video, and more."
Visitors can browse by collection or search the site.</p>
<h3 id="europeana"><a class="header" href="#europeana">europeana</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.europeana.eu/en">europeana</a> is a digital library that acts
as a central repository for libraries, museums, and archives
across the European Union.
In that way, it's very much a European version of the <a href="https://dp.la">DPLA</a>,
which we covered in the prior section.</p>
<h3 id="hathitrust"><a class="header" href="#hathitrust">HathiTrust</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/3051">HathiTrust</a> provides access to books and other items
scanned from major U.S. research libraries, Google, and the Internet Archive.
There is a big focus on public domain works,
which are works that are free of copyright restrictions.
Although that's why I've included it in this section
on web resources,
UK Libraries is a partner institution,
which means you can login to HathiTrust and check out works
that are still under copyright.</p>
<h3 id="project-gutenberg"><a class="header" href="#project-gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is the oldest online ebook
collection on the web,
and even predates the web by 20 years.
All ebooks one Project Gutenberg are free,
and can be read on your computer or ebook reader.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-11"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-11">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In this section, I largely covered educational resources
and digital libraries.
These kinds of sites don't generally pop up in our
everyday web searches unless we're really looking for them.
Thus it's worthwhile to know they exist and explore them
if we're interested in the content.</p>
<p>There are two takeaways here on this topic of web resources.
First, be good at web search.
We covered this in <a href="5-web-information-retrieval.html">section 5</a>.
Second, when search fails,
know the good sites to go to.
I've only covered a handful of them in this and
the prior lecture,
so keep exploring the real stuff.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-6"><a class="header" href="#introduction-6">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>At this point you should have built up a decent collection
of information sources in your Zotero library for your Wikipedia project.
You may have even been using it for your other courses, too, and
if not, then start!
If you need to collect more sources for your Wikipedia article,
this is the time to do it.
Revisit the previous sections to remind yourself
about the existing sources that exist on the web and at the library,
and to remind yourself how to search those sources.</p>
<p>In the remaining weeks of this course,
your final goal is to edit your chosen Wikipedia articles
based on the information resources you've collected.</p>
<p>In order to prepare for the Wikipedia edit,
it's time to return to your Zotero collection.
You should have been reading the sources you've collected,
and taking notes on them in Zotero.
Now is a good time to get caught up and add (more) notes
or refine and edit them and
synthesize them in order to know
where to add your citations to your Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>Zotero and other reference managers offer a number of tools
to help with this process.
As a reminder,
you can use your Zotero browser plugin to automatically add
information sources to your Zotero library.
You can store those sources in folders in your Zotero library.
A folder can be project based.
You can also tag each information source for more organization.
You can highlight and add notes to PDF copies in Zotero.</p>
<p>In the section below,
I will discuss ways to export your work to a
word processor program and how to edit your Wikipedia article.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-with-word-processors"><a class="header" href="#integrating-with-word-processors">Integrating with Word Processors</a></h2>
<p>Although our main project this semester is
to edit a Wikipedia article,
in most cases you will want to work on papers
in a word processing program like Microsoft Word,
Google Docs, or <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice Writer</a>.</p>
<p>Zotero is able to work with the above three word processors.
Mendeley and EndNote are primarily geared toward Microsoft Word,
and if you elected to use those two RMs,
then reach out to your instructor,
or search the web,
for guidance on using
these with those Google Docs or LibreOffice Writer,
if you use those, too.</p>
<p>Using Zotero with Word, Docs, or Writer is straightforward.
The necessary plugins are already installed when you installed
Zotero Desktop, and
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration">additional instructions are available, too</a>.</p>
<p>You'll want to use Zotero as you write papers, etc.
to insert in-text citations and bibliographies.
While Zotero or other reference managers can handle this automatically,
you should still review your in-text citations and bibliographies
to check for any data errors.
If there are errors,
it's likely because the item in Zotero is missing metadata for
some fields (like author, title, journal title, publication date, etc.).
This happens because the source information Zotero extracts
metadata from may be incomplete or malformed.</p>
<p>With Zotero, you can add in-text citations like:
(Smith, 2007) or (Chan, 2018, p. 144) or "Garcia (2020) stated ...".
You can also generate bibliographies using many different styles,
like APA, MLA, Chicago, and so forth.
Zotero will auto-update the bibliography in your document
as you add more in-text citations.
To set a default style, in Zotero,
click on the <strong>Edit</strong> button in the Zotero menu bar,
select <strong>Preferences</strong>,
click on the <strong>Cite</strong> tab, and
then choose your default style,
which will most likely be one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Psychological Association 7th edition</li>
<li>Chicago Manual of Style edition (author-date or full note)</li>
<li>Modern Language Association 9th edition</li>
<li>American Medical Association 11th edition</li>
</ul>
<p>While the preferences window is open,
there are two more things to set.
First, click on the <strong>Export</strong> tab, and under <strong>Item Format</strong>,
select <strong>Wikipedia Citation Templates</strong> from the drop down menu.
This will come in handy when you edit your Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>Second, click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab,
and then click on the drop down menu
under the <strong>OperURL</strong> section, and
scroll down until you find <strong>University of Kentucky</strong>.
This will enable Zotero to retrieve full text
items through InfoKat.</p>
<h2 id="using-zotero-and-a-word-processor"><a class="header" href="#using-zotero-and-a-word-processor">Using Zotero and a Word Processor</a></h2>
<p>Once you've set up some basic preferences,
you can start writing in your preferred word processor.</p>
<p>Zotero will add a new tab in Microsoft Word,
or new toolbar items if you're using Google Docs or LibreOffice Word.
You can use these new functions to add in-text citations,
to extract and insert Zotero notes for items, and
a bibliography.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-12"><a class="header" href="#conclusion-12">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>In this section,
I covered the basics of integrating Zotero
with your word processor.
Although the basics are pretty straightforward,
given the variety of options you have available to you,
you may need to refer to the Zotero documentation for
additional help.</p>

<p>In the
<a href="8-project-setup-wikipedia-part-1.html">Wikipedia Project: Setup</a>
you read about editing Wikipedia articles.
You were also asked to create an account on Wikipedia
and make a small edit to your user page.
In this last section,
your task is to edit the actual Wikipedia articles
that you chose for the project.</p>
<p>By now,
you have selected at least six sources
for your Wikipedia articles:
three sources from the library
and three sources from the web.
You must add two sources as references
to each of your Wikipedia articles.
You can mix up the sources.
For example,
you can add two library sources
to one Wikipedia article,
two web-based sources
to your other Wikipedia article,
and then one library and one web-based
source to your third Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>When you edit your article,
<strong>be sure you are logged in to your Wikipedia account</strong>
when making your edits.
If you are not signed in,
you will not earn credit for this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="to-edit"><a class="header" href="#to-edit">To Edit</a></h2>

<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE</p>
<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional
and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it,
either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for
the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being
considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p>
<p>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the
document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU
General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software,
because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with
manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is
not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We
recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference.</p>
<ol>
<li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the
terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license,
unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The
"Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public
is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy,
modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
law.</p>
<p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or
a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</p>
<p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics,
a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.</p>
<p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the
above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document
does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>
<p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most
5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>
<p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented
in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is
suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors
or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings)
some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for
input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly
available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed
for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF
and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited
only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p>
<p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent
appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
text.</p>
<p>The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the
Document to the public.</p>
<p>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section
name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
"Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ"
according to this definition.</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states
that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are
considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards
disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>VERBATIM COPYING</li>
</ol>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the
license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in
all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may
accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may
publicly display copies.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>COPYING IN QUANTITY</li>
</ol>
<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed
covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license
notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must
present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
other respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you
should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than
100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with
each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network
location from which the general network-using public has access to download
using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the
Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition
to the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document
well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to
provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>MODIFICATIONS</li>
</ol>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do
these things in the Modified Version:</p>
<p>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that
of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there
were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the
same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version
gives permission.</p>
<p>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of
its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from
this requirement.</p>
<p>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
as the publisher.</p>
<p>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</p>
<p>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
other copyright notices.</p>
<p>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p>
<p>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p>
<p>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p>
<p>I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled
"History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item
describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</p>
<p>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These
may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for
a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</p>
<p>K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the
Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</p>
<p>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text
and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part
of the section titles.</p>
<p>M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.</p>
<p>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</p>
<p>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</p>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that
qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document,
you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To
do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section
titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but
endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization
as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage
of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts
in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of
Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one
entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are
acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one,
on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS</li>
</ol>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that
you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the
original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty
Disclaimers.</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are
multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the
title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses,
the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else
a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the
various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise
combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled
"Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</li>
</ol>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License
in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection,
provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each
of the documents in all other respects.</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it
individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects
regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</li>
</ol>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the
compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an
aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate
which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>TRANSLATION</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright
holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include
a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and
any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English
version of this License and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original
version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or
"History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will
typically require changing the actual title.</p>

<li>TERMINATION</li>
</ol>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of
a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use
it.</p>

<li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</li>
</ol>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free
Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has
been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>RELICENSING</li>
</ol>
<p>"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide
Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent
facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit
is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or
"MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus
published on the MMC site.</p>
<p>"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license
published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with
a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future
copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.</p>
<p>"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as
part of another Document.</p>
<p>An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and
if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than
this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1)
had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
to November 1, 2008.</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under
CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC
is eligible for relicensing.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</p>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the
License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices
just after the title page:</p>
<p>Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.</p>
<p>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included
in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</p>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace
the "with … Texts." line with this:</p>
<p>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</p>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination
of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend
releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free
software.</p>
